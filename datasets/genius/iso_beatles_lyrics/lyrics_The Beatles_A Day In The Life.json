 "lyrics": "[Verse 1: John Lennon]\nI read the news today\u2014oh, boy\nAbout a lucky man who made the grade\nAnd though the news was rather sad\nWell, I just had to laugh\nI saw the photograph\nHe blew his mind out in a car\nHe didn't notice that the lights had changed\nA crowd of people stood and stared\nThey'd seen his face before\nNobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords\n\n[Verse 2: John Lennon]\nI saw a film today, oh boy\nThe English Army had just won the war\nA crowd of people turned away\nBut I just had to look\nHaving read the book\n\n[Refrain: John Lennon]\nI'd love to turn you on\n[Bridge: Paul McCartney]\n*alarm clock rings*\nWoke up, fell out of bed\nDragged a comb across my head\nFound my way downstairs and drank a cup\nAnd looking up I noticed I was late\nFound my coat and grabbed my hat\nMade the bus in seconds flat\nFound my way upstairs and had a smoke\nAnd somebody spoke and I went into a dream\n[Interlude: John Lennon]\nAhh-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh\n\n[Verse 3: John Lennon]\nI read the news today\u2014oh, boy\nFour thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire\nAnd though the holes were rather small\nThey had to count them all\nNow they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall\n\n[Refrain: John Lennon]\nI'd love to turn you on\n[Instrumental Outro]67EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
