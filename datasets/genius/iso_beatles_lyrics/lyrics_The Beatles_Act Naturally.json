 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey're gonna put me in the movies\nThey're gonna make a big star out of me\nWe'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely\nAnd all I gotta do is act naturally\n\n[Chorus]\nWell I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star\nMight win an Oscar, you can never tell\nThe movies gonna make me a big star\n'Cause I can play the part so well\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I hope you'll come and see me in the movies\nThen I know that you will plainly see\nThe biggest fool that ever hit the big time\nAnd all I gotta do is act naturally\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely\nAnd begging down upon his bended knee\nI'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing\nAll I have to do is act naturally\n\n[Chorus]\nWell I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star\nMight win an Oscar, you can never tell\nThe movies gonna make me a big star\n'Cause I can play the part so well\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I hope you'll come and see me in the movies\nThen I know that you will plainly see\nThe biggest fool that ever hit the big time\nAnd all I gotta do is act naturally"
