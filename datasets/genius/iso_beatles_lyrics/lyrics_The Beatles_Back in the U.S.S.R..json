(Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBeen away so long, I hardly knew the place\nGee, it's good to be back home\nLeave it til' tomorrow to unpack my case\nHoney, disconnect the phone\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm back in the U.S.S.R\nYou don't know how lucky you are, boy\nBack in the U.S\nBack in the U.S\nBack in the U.S.S.R.\u200b\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, the Ukraine girls really knock me out\nThey leave the West behind\nAnd Moscow girls make me sing and shout\nThat Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind\nOh, come on!\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.\u200b\nYou don't know how lucky you are, boys\nBack in the U.S.S.R.\u200b\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, the Ukraine girls really knock me out\nThey leave the West behind\nAnd Moscow girls make me sing and shout\nThat Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south\nTake me to your daddy's farm\nLet me hear your balalaikas ringing out\nCome and keep your comrade warm\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm back in the U.S.S.R. (Hey)\nYou don't know how lucky you are, boys\nBack in the U.S.S.R\n\n[Outro]\nOh, let me tell you, honey\nHey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.\u200b\nHey, it's so good to be home\nYeah, back in the U.S.S.R.\u200b13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
