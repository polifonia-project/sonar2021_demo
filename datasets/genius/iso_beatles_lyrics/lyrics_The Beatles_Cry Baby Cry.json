 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nCry baby cry\nMake your mother sigh\nShe's old enough to know better\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe king of Marigold was in the kitchen\nCooking breakfast for the queen\nThe queen was in the parlour\nPlaying piano for the children of the king\n\n[Chorus]\nCry baby cry\nMake your mother sigh\nShe's old enough to know better\nSo cry baby cry\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe king was in the garden\nPicking flowers for a friend who came to play\nThe queen was in the playroom\nPainting pictures for the children's holiday\n\n[Chorus]\nCry baby cry\nMake your mother sigh\nShe's old enough to know better\nSo cry baby cry\n[Verse 3]\nThe duchess of Kircaldy always smiling\nAnd arriving late for tea\nThe duke was having problems\nWith a message at the local Bird and Bee\n\n[Chorus]\nCry baby cry\nMake your mother sigh\nShe's old enough to know better\nSo cry baby cry\n\n[Verse 4]\nAt twelve o'clock a meeting round the table\nFor a seance in the dark\nWith voices out of nowhere\nPut on specially by the children for a lark\n\n[Chorus]\nCry baby cry\nMake your mother sigh\nShe's old enough to know better\nSo cry baby cry\n\nCry cry cry baby\nMake your mother sigh\nShe's old enough to know better\nSo cry baby cry\n[Outro]\nCan you take me back where I came from?\nCan you take me back?\nCan you take me back where I came from?\nBrother, can you take me back?\nCan you take me back?\nMm, can you take me where I came from?\nCan you take me back?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
