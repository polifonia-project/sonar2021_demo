 "lyrics": "[Chorus]\n(She's got the devil in her heart)\nBut her eyes, they tantalize\n(She's going to tear your heart apart)\nOh, her lips, they really thrill me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'll take my chances, for romance is\nSo important to me\nShe'll never hurt me, she won't desert me\nShe's an angel sent to me\n\n[Chorus]\n(She's got the devil in her heart)\nNo, no, this I can't believe\n(She's going to tear your heart apart)\nNo, no, nay will she deceive\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't believe that she'll ever, ever go\nNot when she hugs me and says she loves me so\nShe'll never hurt me, she won't desert me\nListen, can't you see?\n\n[Chorus]\n(She's got the devil in her heart)\nOh, no, no, no, this I can't believe\n(She's going to tear your heart apart)\nNo, no, nay will she deceive\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't take chances if your romance is\nSo important to you\nShe'll never hurt me, she won't desert me\nShe's an angel sent to me\n\n[Chorus]\n(She's got the devil in her heart)\nNo, no, no, no, this I can't believe\n(She's going to tear your heart apart)\nNo, no, nay will she deceive\n\n[Outro]\n(She's got the devil in her heart)\n'Cause she's an angel sent to me\n(She's got the devil in her heart)\nNo, she's an angel sent to me"
