 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSince she's been gone\nI want no one to talk to me\nIt's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see\nSo go away, leave me alone\nDon't bother me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't believe that she would leave me on my own\nIt's just not right, when every night I'm all alone\nI've got no time for you right now\nDon't bother me\n\n[Bridge]\nI know I'll never be the same\nIf I don't get her back again\nBecause I know she'll always be\nThe only girl for me\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut till she's here\nPlease, don't come near, just stay away\nI'll let you know when she's come home until that day\nDon't come around, leave me alone\nDon't bother me\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Refrain]\nI've got no time for you right now\nDon't bother me\n\n[Bridge]\nI know I'll never be the same\nIf I don't get her back again\nBecause I know she'll always be\nThe only girl for me\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut till she's here\nPlease, don't come near, just stay away\nI'll let you know when she's come home until that day\nDon't come around, leave me alone\nDon't bother me\n\n[Outro]\nDon't bother me\nDon't bother me\nDon't bother me\nDon't bother me\nDon't-"
