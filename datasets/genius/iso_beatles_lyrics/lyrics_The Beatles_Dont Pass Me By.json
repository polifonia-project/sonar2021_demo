 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI listen for your footsteps coming up the drive\nListen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive\nWaiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door\nI don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf\nSee the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself\nI wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself\nI don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue\n'Cause you know, darling, I love only you\nYou'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go\nDon't pass me by\nDon't make me cry\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair\nYou were in a car crash, and you lost your hair\nYou said that you would be late, about an hour or two\nI said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue\n'Cause you know, darling, I love only you\nYou'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go\nDon't pass me by\nDon't make me cry\n[Interlude]\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue\n'Cause you know, darling, I love only you\nYou'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go\nDon't pass me by\nDon't make me cry1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
