 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was alone, I took a ride\nI didn't know what I would find there\nAnother road where maybe I\nCould see another kind of mind there\nOoh, then I suddenly see you\nOoh, did I tell you I need you\nEvery single day of my life?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou didn't run, you didn't lie\nYou knew I wanted just to hold you\nAnd had you gone, you knew in time\nWe'd meet again, for I had told you\nOoh, you were meant to be near me\nOoh, and I want you to hear me\nSay we'll be together every day\n\n[Refrain]\nGot to get you into my life\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat can I do, what can I be?\nWhen I'm with you I want to stay there\nIf I'm true, I'll never leave\nAnd if I do, I know the way there\nOoh, then I suddenly see you\nOoh, did I tell you I need you\nEvery single day of my life\n[Refrain]\nGot to get you into my life\n\n[Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got to get you into my life\n\n[Outro]\nI was alone, I took a ride\nI didn't know what I would find there\nAnother road where maybe I\nCould see another kind of mind there\nAnd suddenly I see you\nDid I tell you I need you\nEvery single day of my life?11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
