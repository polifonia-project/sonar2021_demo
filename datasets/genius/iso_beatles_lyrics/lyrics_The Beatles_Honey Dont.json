I said...)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell sometimes I love you on a Saturday night\nSunday morning you don't look right\nYou've been out painting the town\nAh ah baby, been stepping around\n\n[Chorus]\nBut ah ah well honey don't, I said honey don't\nHoney don't, honey don't, honey don't\nI say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't\n(Ah rock on George, for Ringo one time! Woo!)\n\n[Outro]\nWell honey don't, well honey don't\nUh little, little honey don't\nI say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't"
