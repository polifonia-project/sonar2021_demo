 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nShe was a working girl North of England way\nNow she's hit the big time in the U.S.A.\u200b\nAnd if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say\n\n[Verse 1]\nHoney Pie, you are making me crazy\nI'm in love, but I'm lazy\nSo won't you please come home\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, honey pie, my position is tragic\nCome and show me the magic\nOf your Hollywood song\n\n[Bridge 1]\nYou became a legend of the silver screen\nAnd now the thought of meeting you\nMakes me weak in the knee\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic\nSail across the Atlantic\nTo be where you belong\nHoney pie, come back to me\n[Instrumental Verse: Solo guitar John Lennon]\nOoh, yeah\nI like it like that, oh ah\n\n[Instrumental Verse: Ad lib Vocal]\nI like this kind of hot kind of music\nHot kind of music\nPlay it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues\n\n[Bridge 2]\nWill the wind that blew her boat across the sea\nKindly send her sailing back to me?\nTee, tee, tee\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow Honey Pie you are making me crazy\nI'm in love but I'm lazy\nSo won't you please come home\nCome, come back to me, Honey Pie\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, oh\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nHoney Pie, Honey Pie1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
