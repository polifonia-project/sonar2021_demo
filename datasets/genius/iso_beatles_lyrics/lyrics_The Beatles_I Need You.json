I need you\n\n[Bridge]\nBut when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore\nThat's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlease remember how I feel about you\nI could never really live without you\nSo, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you\nI need you\nI need you"
