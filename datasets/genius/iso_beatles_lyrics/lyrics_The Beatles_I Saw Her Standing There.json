(Oh)\nWhen I saw her standing there?\n\n[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]\nWell, she looked at me, and I, I could see\nThat before too long, I'd fall in love with her\nShe wouldn't dance with another (Woah)\nWhen I saw her standing there\n[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]\nWell, my heart went \"boom\" when I crossed that room\nAnd I held her hand in mine\n\n[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]\nWell, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight\nAnd before too long, I fell in love with her\nNow, I'll never dance with another (Woah)\nSince I saw her standing there\n\n[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]\n[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]\nWell, my heart went \"boom\" when I crossed that room\nAnd I held her hand in mine\n\n[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]\nOh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight\nAnd before too long, I fell in love with her\nNow I'll never dance with another (Oh)\nSince I saw her standing there\n\n[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]\nOh, since I saw her standing there\nYeah, well, since I saw her standing there20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
