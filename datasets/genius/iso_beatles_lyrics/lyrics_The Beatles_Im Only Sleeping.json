 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I wake up early in the morning\nLift my head, I'm still yawning\nWhen I'm in the middle of a dream\nStay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)\n\n[Chorus 1]\nPlease, don't wake me, no, don't shake me\nLeave me where I am, I'm only sleeping\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody seems to think I'm lazy\nI don't mind, I think they're crazy\nRunning everywhere at such a speed\nTill they find there's no need (There's no need)\n\n[Chorus 2]\nPlease, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away\nAnd after all, I'm only sleeping\n\n[Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nKeeping an eye on the world going by my window\nTaking my time\n[Verse 3]\nLying there and staring at the ceiling\nWaiting for a sleepy feeling\n[Backwards Guitar Solo: George Harrison]\n\n[Chorus 2]\nPlease, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away\nAnd after all, I'm only sleeping\n\n[Break: John Lennon, Paul McCartney]\nYawn, Paul!\n*Yawns*\n\n[Bridge]\nKeeping an eye on the world going by my window\nTaking my time\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I wake up early in the morning\nLift my head, I'm still yawning\nWhen I'm in the middle of a dream\nStay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)\n\n[Chorus 1]\nPlease, don't wake me, no, don't shake me\nLeave me where I am, I'm only sleeping14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
