 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink\nI'm so tired, my mind is on the blink\nI wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink\nNo, no, no\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm so tired, I don't know what to do\nI'm so tired, my mind is set on you\nI wonder should I call you but I know what you would do\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'd say I'm putting you on\nBut it's no joke, it's doing me harm\nYou know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain\nYou know it's three weeks, I'm going insane\nYou know I'd give you everything I've got\nFor a little peace of mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset\nAlthough I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette\nAnd curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'd say I'm putting you on\nBut it's no joke, it's doing me harm\nYou know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain\nYou know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!\nYou know I'd give you everything I've got\nFor a little peace of mind\nI'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind\nI'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind\n[Outro]\nMonsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
