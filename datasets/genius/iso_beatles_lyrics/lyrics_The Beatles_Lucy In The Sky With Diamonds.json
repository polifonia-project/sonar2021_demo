 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPicture yourself in a boat on a river\nWith tangerine trees and marmalade skies\nSomebody calls you, you answer quite slowly\nA girl with kaleidoscope eyes\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nCellophane flowers of yellow and green\nTowering over your head\nLook for the girl with the sun in her eyes\nAnd she's gone\n\n[Chorus]\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nAhh\n\n[Verse 2]\nFollow her down to a bridge by a fountain\nWhere rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies\nEveryone smiles as you drift past the flowers\nThat grow so incredibly high\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nNewspaper taxis appear on the shore\nWaiting to take you away\nClimb in the back with your head in the clouds\nAnd you're gone\n[Chorus]\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nAhh\n\n[Verse 3]\nPicture yourself on a train in a station\nWith plasticine porters with looking glass ties\nSuddenly, someone is there at the turnstile\nThe girl with kaleidoscope eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nAhh\n\n[Chorus]\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nAhh\n\n[Chorus]\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nLucy in the sky with diamonds\nAhh49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
