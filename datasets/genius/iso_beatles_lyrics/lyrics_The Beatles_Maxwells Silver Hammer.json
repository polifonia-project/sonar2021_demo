 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nJoan was quizzical, studied pataphysical\nScience in the home\nLate nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh\nMaxwell Edison, majoring in medicine\nCalls her on the phone\n\"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?\"\nBut as she's getting ready to go\nA knock comes on the door\n\n[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again\nTeacher gets annoyed\nWishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene\nShe tells Max to stay when the class has gone away\nSo he waits behind\nWriting fifty times \"I must not be so, o, o, o\"\nBut when she turns her back on the boy\nHe creeps up from behind\n\n[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nP. C. 31 said, \"We caught a dirty one\"\nMaxwell stands alone\nPainting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh\nRose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery\nSay he must go free (Maxwell must go free)\nThe judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o\nBut as the words are leaving his lips\nA noise comes from behind\n\n[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that he was dead\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa, whoa, whoa-oa\n(Do-do-do-do-do)\n(Silver hammer man)"
