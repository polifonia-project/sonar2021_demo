 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThis happened once before\nWhen I came to your door\nNo reply\nThey said it wasn't you\nBut I saw you peep through your window\nI saw the light, I saw the light\nI know that you saw me\n'Cause I looked up to see your face\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried to telephone\nThey said you were not home\nThat's a lie\n'Cause I know where you've been\nI saw you walk in your door\nI nearly died, I nearly died\n'Cause you walked hand in hand\nWith another man in my place\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I were you, I'd realise that I\nLove you more than any other guy\nAnd I'll forgive the lies that I\nHeard before when you gave me no reply\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried to telephone\nThey said you were not home\nThat's a lie\n'Cause I know where you've been\nI saw you walk in your door\nI nearly died, I nearly died\n'Cause you walked hand in hand\nWith another man in my place\n\n[Outro]\nNo reply, no reply"
