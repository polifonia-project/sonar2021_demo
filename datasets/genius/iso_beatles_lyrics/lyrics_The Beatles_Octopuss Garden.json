 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'd like to be under the sea\nIn an octopus's garden in the shade\nHe'd let us in, knows where we've been\nIn his octopus's garden in the shade\nI'd ask my friends to come and see\nAn octopus's garden with me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd like to be under the sea\nIn an octopus's garden in the shade\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe would be warm below the storm\nIn our little hide-a-way beneath the waves\nResting our head on the sea bed\nIn an octopus's garden near a cave\nWe would sing and dance around\nBecause we know we can't be found\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd like to be under the sea\nIn an octopus's garden in the shade\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe would shout and swim about\nThe coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)\nOh what joy for every girl and boy\nKnowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)\nWe would be so happy, you and me\nNo one there to tell us what to do\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd like to be under the sea\nIn an octopus's garden with you\n\n[Outro]\nIn an octopus's garden with you\nIn an octopus's garden with you"
