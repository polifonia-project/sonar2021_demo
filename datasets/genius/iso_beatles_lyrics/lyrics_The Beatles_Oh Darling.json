Darling, if you leave me\nI'll never make it alone\nBelieve me when I beg you (Woo!)\nDon't ever leave me alone\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen you told me, you didn't need me anymore\nWell, you know I nearly broke down and cried\nWhen you told me, that you didn't need me anymore\nWell, you know I nearly fell down and died\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh! Darling, if you leave me\nI'll never make it alone\nBelieve me when I tell you\nI'll never do you no harm\n(Believe me, darling!)\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen you told me (Woo!) you didn't need me anymore\nWell, you know I nearly broke down and cried\nWhen you told me you didn't need me anymore\nWell, you know I nearly fell down and died\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh! Darling, please believe me\nI'll never let you down\n(Oh! Believe me, darling)\nBelieve me when I tell you\nI'll never do you no harm"
