 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHave you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?\nAnd for all the little piggies, life is getting worse\nAlways having dirt to play around in\n\n[Verse 2]\nHave you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?\nYou will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt\nAlways have clean shirts to play around in\n\n[Bridge]\nIn their sties with all their backing\nThey don't care what goes on around\nIn their life, there's something lacking\nWhat they need's a damn good whacking!\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives\nYou can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives\nClutching forks and knives to eat their bacon\n\n[Outro]\nOne more timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
