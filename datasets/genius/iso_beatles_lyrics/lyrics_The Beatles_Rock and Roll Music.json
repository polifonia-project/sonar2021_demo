 "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nJust let me hear some of that rock and roll music\nAny old way you choose it\nIt's got a back beat, you can't lose it\nAny old time you use it\nIt's got to be rock and roll music\nIf you want to dance with me\nIf you want to dance with me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've got no kick against modern jazz\nUnless they try to play it too darn fast\nAnd lose the beauty of the melody\nUntil they sound just like a symphony\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I go for that that rock and roll music\nAny old way you choose it\nIt's got a back beat, you can't lose it\nAny old time you use it\nIt's got to be rock and roll music\nIf you want to dance with me\nIf you want to dance with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI took my loved one over across the tracks\nSo she can hear my man a wailin' sax\nI must admit they have a rocking band\nMan, they were blowing like a hurricane\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I go for that rock and roll music\nAny old way you choose it\nIt's got a back beat, you can't lose it\nAny old time you use it\nIt's got to be rock and roll music\nIf you want to dance with me\nIf you want to dance with me\n\n[Verse 3]\nWay down South they had a jubilee\nThem Georgia folks they had a jamboree\nThey're drinking home brew from a wooden cup\nThe folks dancing there are all shook up\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd started playing that rock and roll music\nAny old time you use it\nIt's got a back beat, you can't lose it\nAny old time you use it\nGot to be rock and roll music\nIf you want to dance with me\nIf you want to dance with me\n\n[Verse 4]\nDon't care to hear them play a tango\nAnd in the mood they take a mambo\nIt's way to early for a congo\nSo keep a rocking that piano\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I go for that rock and roll music\nAny old time you use it\nIt's got a back beat, you can't lose it\nAny old time you use it\nOh, you got rock 'n roll music\nIf you want to dance with me\nIf you want to dance with me"
