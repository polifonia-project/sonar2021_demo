 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNow somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota\nThere lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon\nAnd one day his woman ran off with another guy\nHit young Rocky in the eye\nRocky didn't like that\nHe said, \"I'm gonna get that boy\"\nSo one day he walked into town\nBooked himself a room in the local saloon\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd Rocky Raccoon checked into his room\nOnly to find Gideon's bible\nBut Rocky had come equipped with a gun\nTo shoot off the legs of his rival\n\n[Verse 2]\nHis rival it seems had broken his dreams\nBy stealing the girl of his fancy\nHer name was Magill, and she called herself Lil\nBut everyone knew her as Nancy\nNow, she and her man, who called himself Dan\nWere in the next room at the hoe-down\nAnd Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin\nHe said, \"Danny boy, this is a showdown\"\nBut Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot\nAnd Rocky collapsed in the corner\n[Instrumental bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow the doctor came in stinking of gin\nAnd proceeded to lie on the table\nHe said, \"Rocky, you met your match\"\nAnd Rocky said, \"Doc, it's only a scratch\nAnd I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room\nOnly to find Gideon's bible\nGideon checked out, and he left it no doubt\nTo help with good Rocky's revival\n\n[Outro]\nC'mon, Rocky boy\nC'mon, Rocky boy14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
