 "lyrics": "[Verse 1: George Harrison]\nWell, gonna write a little letter\nGonna mail it to my local DJ\nIt's a rocking little record\nI want my jockey to play\nRoll over Beethoven\nGotta hear it again today\n\n[Verse 2: George Harrison]\nYou know my temperature's rising\nAnd the jukebox blows a fuse\nMy heart's beating rhythm\nAnd my soul keeps singing the blues\nRoll over Beethoven\nAnd tell Tchaikovsky the news\n\n[Verse 3: George Harrison]\nI've got a rocking pneumonia\nI need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)\nI think I caught off the writer\nSitting down by the rhythm revue\nRoll over Beethoven\nRocking in two by two\n\n[Verse 4: George Harrison]\nWell if you feel it and like it\nWell get your lover and reel and rock it\nRoll it over and move on up\nJust a trifle further and reel and rock it\nRoll it over\nRoll over Beethoven\nRocking in two by two (Woo)\n\n[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]\n\n[Verse 5: George Harrison]\nWell early in the morning\nI'm a-giving you the warning\nDon't you step on my blue suede shoes\nHey diddle diddle\nI'll play my fiddle\nAin't got nothing to lose\nRoll over Beethoven\nAnd tell Tchaikovsky the news\n\n[Verse 6: George Harrison]\nYou know she wiggles like a glow worm\nDance like a spinning top\nShe's got a crazy partner\nOughta see 'em reel and rock\nAs long as she got a dime\nThe music will never stop\n\n[Outro: George Harrison]\nRoll over Beethoven\nRoll over Beethoven\nRoll over Beethoven\nRoll over Beethoven\nRoll over Beethoven\nDig to these rhythm and blues"
