 "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]\nWednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins\nSilently closing her bedroom door\nLeaving the note that she hoped would say more\nShe goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief\nQuietly turning the backdoor key\nStepping outside, she is free\n[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]\nShe (We gave her most of our lives)\nIs leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)\nHome (We gave her everything money could buy)\nShe's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)\nFor so many years\n\n[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]\nFather snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown\nPicks up the letter that's lying there\nStanding alone at the top of the stairs\nShe breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone\nWhy would she treat us so thoughtlessly\nHow could she do this to me\n\n[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]\nShe (We never thought of ourselves)\nIs leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)\nHome (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)\nShe's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)\nFor so many years\n[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]\nFriday morning at nine o'clock she is far away\nWaiting to keep the appointment she made\nMeeting a man from the motor trade\n\n[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]\nShe (What did we do that was wrong)\nIs having (We didn't know it was wrong)\nFun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)\nSomething inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)\nFor so many years\n\n[Outro]\nShe's leaving home (Bye-bye)6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
