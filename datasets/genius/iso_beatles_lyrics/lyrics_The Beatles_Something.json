 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSomething in the way she moves\nAttracts me like no other lover\nSomething in the way she woos me\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want to leave her now\nYou know I believe and how\n\n[Verse 2]\nSomewhere in her smile she knows\nThat I don't need no other lover\nSomething in her style that shows me\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want to leave her now\nYou know I believe and how\n\n[Bridge]\nYou're asking me will my love grow\nI don't know, I don't know\nYou stick around, now it may show\nI don't know, I don't know\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomething in the way she knows\nAnd all I have to do is think of her\nSomething in the things she shows me\n\n[Outro]\nI don't want to leave her now\nYou know I believe and how"
