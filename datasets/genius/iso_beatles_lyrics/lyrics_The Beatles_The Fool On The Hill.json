 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDay after day, alone on a hill\nThe man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still\nBut nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool\nAnd he never gives an answer\n\n[Chorus]\nBut the fool on the hill sees the sun going down\nAnd the eyes in his head see the world spinning around\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell on the way, head in a cloud\nThe man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud\nBut nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make\nAnd he never seems to notice\n\n[Chorus]\nBut the fool on the hill sees the sun going down\nAnd the eyes in his head see the world spinning around\n\n{Instrumental Bridge}\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do\nAnd he never shows his feelings\n[Chorus]\nBut the fool on the hill sees the sun going down\nAnd the eyes in his head see the world spinning around\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nRound and round and round and round and round\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools\nThey don't like him\n\n[Chorus]\nThe fool on the hill sees the sun going down\nAnd the eyes in his head see the world spinning around\n[Outro]\nOh (Round and round and round)\nOh9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
