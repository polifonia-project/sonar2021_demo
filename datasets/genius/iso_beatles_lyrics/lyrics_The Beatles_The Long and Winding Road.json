 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe long and winding road that leads to your door\nWill never disappear, I've seen that road before\nIt always leads me here\nLead me to your door\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe wild and windy night that the rain washed away\nHas left a pool of tears, crying for the day\nWhy leave me standing here?\nLet me know the way\n\n[Bridge]\nMany times I've been alone, and many times I've cried\nAnyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd still they lead me back to the long and winding road\nYou left me standing here a long, long time ago\nDon't leave me waiting here\nLead me to your door\n[Orchestral Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut still they lead me back to the long and winding road\nYou left me standing here a long, long time ago\nDon't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)\nLead me to your door\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
