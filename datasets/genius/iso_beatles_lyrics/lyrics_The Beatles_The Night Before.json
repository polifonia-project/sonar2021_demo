 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)\nLove was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)\nNow, today, I find you have changed your mind\nTreat me like you did the night before\n\n[Verse 2]\nWere you telling lies? (Ah, the night before?)\nWas I so unwise? (Ah, the night before?)\nWhen I held you near, you were so sincere\nTreat me like you did the night before\n\n[Bridge]\nLast night is a night I will remember you by\nWhen I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe said our goodbye (Ah, the night before)\nLove was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)\nNow, today, I find you have changed your mind\nTreat me like you did the night before\n(Yes)\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Refrain]\nWhen I held you near, you were so sincere\nTreat me like you did the night before\n\n[Bridge]\nLast night is a night I will remember you by\nWhen I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry\n\n[Verse 4]\nWere you telling lies? (Ah, the night before)\nWas I so unwise? (Ah, the night before)\nWhen I held you near, you were so sincere\nTreat me like you did the night before\nLike the night before"
