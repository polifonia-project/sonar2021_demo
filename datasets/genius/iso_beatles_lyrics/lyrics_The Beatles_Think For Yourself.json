 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've got a word or two\nTo say about the things that you do\nYou're telling all those lies\nAbout the good things that we can have\nIf we close our eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nDo what you want to do\nAnd go where you're going to\nThink for yourself\n'Cause I won't be there with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI left you far behind\nThe ruins of the life that you have in mind\nAnd though you still can't see\nI know your mind's made up\nYou're gonna cause more misery\n\n[Chorus]\nDo what you want to do\nAnd go where you're going to\nThink for yourself\n'Cause I won't be there with you\n[Verse 3]\nAlthough your mind's opaque\nTry thinking more if just for your own sake\nThe future still looks good\nAnd you've got time to rectify\nAll the things that you should\n\n[Chorus]\nDo what you want to do\nAnd go where you're going to\nThink for yourself\n'Cause I won't be there with you\nDo what you want to do\nAnd go where you're going to\nThink for yourself\n'Cause I won't be there with you\n\n[Outro]\nThink for yourself\n'Cause I won't be there with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
