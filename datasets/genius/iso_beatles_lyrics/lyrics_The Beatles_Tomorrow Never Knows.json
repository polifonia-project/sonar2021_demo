 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTurn off your mind, relax and float downstream\nIt is not dying, it is not dying\n\n[Verse 2]\nLay down all thoughts, surrender to the void\nIt is shining, it is shining\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat you may see the meaning of within\nIt is being, it is being\n[Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nThat love is all and love is everyone\nIt is knowing, it is knowing\n\n[Verse 5]\nThat ignorance and hate may mourn the dead\nIt is believing, it is believing\n\n[Verse 6]\nBut listen to the colour of your dreams\nIt is not living, it is not living\n[Verse 7]\nOr play the game \"Existence\" to the end\nOf the beginning, of the beginning\n\n[Outro]\nOf the beginning, of the beginning\nOf the beginning, of the beginning\nOf the beginning19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
