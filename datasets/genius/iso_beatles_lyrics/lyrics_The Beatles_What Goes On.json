 "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nWhat goes on in your heart?\nWhat goes on in your mind?\nYou are tearin' me apart\nWhen you treat me so unkind\nWhat goes on in your mind?\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe other day I saw you as I walked along the road\nBut when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold\nIt's so easy for a girl like you to lie\nTell me why\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat goes on in your heart?\nWhat goes on in your mind?\nYou are tearin' me apart\nWhen you treat me so unkind\nWhat goes on in your mind?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time\nBut now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind\nIt's so easy for a girl like you to lie\nTell me why\nWhat goes on in your heart?\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI used to think of no one else but you were just the same\nYou didn't even think of me as someone with a name\nDid you mean to break my heart and watch me die?\nTell me why\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat goes on in your heart?\nWhat goes on in your mind?\nYou are tearing me apart\nWhen you treat me so unkind\nWhat goes on in your mind?5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
