 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\nI look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping\nStill my guitar gently weeps\n\n[Bridge 1]\nI don't know why nobody told you\nHow to unfold your love\nI don't know how someone controlled you\nThey bought and sold you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI look at the world, and I notice it's turning\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\nWith every mistake, we must surely be learning\nStill my guitar gently weeps\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge 2]\nI don't know how you were diverted\nYou were perverted too\nI don't know how you were inverted\nNo one alerted you\n[Verse 3]\nI look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\n(I look) Look at you all\nStill my guitar gently weeps\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
