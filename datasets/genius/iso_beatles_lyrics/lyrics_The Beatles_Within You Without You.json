 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe were talking about the space between us all\nAnd the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion\nNever glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were talking about the love we all could share\nWhen we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love\nWith our love, we could save the world, if they only knew\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTry to realise it's all within yourself\nNo one else can make you change\nAnd to see you're really only very small\nAnd life flows on within you and without you\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe were talking about the love that's gone so cold\nAnd the people who gain the world and lose their soul\nThey don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWhen you've seen beyond yourself then you may find\nPeace of mind is waiting there\nAnd the time will come when you see we're all one\nAnd life flows on within you and without you\n[Sounds of children laughing]20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
