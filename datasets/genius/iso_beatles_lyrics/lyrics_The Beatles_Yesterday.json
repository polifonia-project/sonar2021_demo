 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYesterday\nAll my troubles seemed so far away\nNow it looks as though they're here to stay\nOh, I believe in yesterday\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuddenly\nI'm not half the man I used to be\nThere's a shadow hanging over me\nOh, yesterday came suddenly\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy she had to go\nI don't know, she wouldn't say\nI said something wrong\nNow I long for yesterday\n\n[Verse 3]\nYesterday\nLove was such an easy game to play\nNow I need a place to hide away\nOh, I believe in yesterday\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy she had to go\nI don't know, she wouldn't say\nI said something wrong\nNow I long for yesterday\n\n[Verse 3]\nYesterday\nLove was such an easy game to play\nNow I need a place to hide away\nOh, I believe in yesterday\n\n[Outro]\nMmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm"
