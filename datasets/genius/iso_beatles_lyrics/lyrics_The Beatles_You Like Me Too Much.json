 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThough you've gone away this morning\nYou'll be back again tonight\nTelling me there'll be no next time\nIf I just don't treat you right\nYou'll never leave me and you know it's true\n'Cause you like me too much and I like you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou've tried before to leave me\nBut you haven't got the nerve\nTo walk out and make me lonely\nWhich is all that I deserve\nYou'll never leave me and you know it's true\n'Cause you like me too much and I like you\n\n[Bridge]\nI really do, and it's nice when you believe me\nIf you leave me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI will follow you and bring you back where you belong\n'Cause I couldn't really stand it\nI admit that I was wrong\nI wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true\n'Cause you like me too much and I like you\n\n[Refrain]\n'Cause you like me too much and I like you\n\n[Bridge]\nI really do, and it's nice when you believe me\nIf you leave me\n\n[Verse 4]\nI will follow you and bring you back where you belong\n'Cause I couldn't really stand it\nI admit that I was wrong\nI wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true\n'Cause you like me too much and I like you\n'Cause you like me too much and I like you"
