 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYour day breaks, your mind aches\nYou find that all her words of kindness linger on\nWhen she no longer needs you\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe wakes up, she makes up\nShe takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry\nShe no longer needs you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd in her eyes, you see nothing\nNo sign of love behind the tears\nCried for no one\nA love that should have lasted years\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou want her, you need her\nAnd yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead\nYou think she needs you\n\n[French Horn Solo: Alan Civil]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd in her eyes you see nothing\nNo sign of love behind the tears\nCried for no one\nA love that should have lasted years\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou stay home, she goes out\nShe says that long ago she knew someone\nBut now he's gone, she doesn't need him\n\n[Verse 5]\nYour day breaks, your mind aches\nThere will be times when all the things she said will fill your head\nYou won't forget her\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd in her eyes you see nothing\nNo sign of love behind the tears\nCried for no one\nA love that should have lasted years"
