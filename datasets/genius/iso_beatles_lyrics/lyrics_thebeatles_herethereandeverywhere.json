 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nTo lead a better life I need my love to be here\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere, making each day of the year\nChanging my life with the wave of her hand\nNobody can deny that there's something there\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere, running my hands through her hair\nBoth of us thinking how good it can be\nSomeone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there\n\n[Bridge]\nI want her everywhere and if she's beside me\nI know I need never care\nBut to love her is to need her everywhere\n\n[Verse 3]\nKnowing that love is to share\nEach one believing that love never dies\nWatching her eyes and hoping I'm always there\n\n[Bridge]\nI want her everywhere and if she's beside me\nI know I need never care\nBut to love her is to need her everywhere\n[Verse 3]\nKnowing that love is to share\nEach one believing that love never dies\nWatching her eyes and hoping I'm always there\n\n[Outro]\nI will be there and everywhere\nHere, there and everywhere11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
