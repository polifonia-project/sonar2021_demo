 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI want to tell you\nMy head is filled with things to say\nWhen you're here\nAll those words, they seem to slip away\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I get near you\nThe games begin to drag me down\nIt's all right\nI'll make you maybe next time around\n\n[Bridge 1]\nBut if I seem to act unkind\nIt's only me, it's not my mind\nThat is confusing things\n\n[Verse 3]\nI want to tell you\nI feel hung up but I don't know why\nI don't mind\nI could wait forever, I've got time\n\n[Bridge 2]\nSometimes I wish I knew you well\nThen I could speak my mind and tell you\nMaybe you'd understand\n[Verse 3]\nI want to tell you\nI feel hung up but I don't know why\nI don't mind\nI could wait forever, I've got time\n\n[Outro]\nI've got time\nI've got time3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
