 "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]\nIt was twenty years ago today\nWhen Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play\nThey've been going in and out of style\nBut they're guaranteed to raise a smile\nSo may I introduce to you\nThe act you've known for all these years\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\n\n[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, & Ringo Starr]\nWe're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\nWe hope you will enjoy the show\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\nSit back and let the evening go\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\n\n[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, & George Harrison]\nIt's wonderful to be here\nIt's certainly a thrill\nYou're such a lovely audience\nWe'd like to take you home with us\nWe'd love to take you home\n\n[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]\nI don't really want to stop the show\nBut I thought you might like to know\nThat the singer's going to sing a song\nAnd he wants you all to sing along\nSo let me introduce to you\nThe one and only Billy Shears\nAnd Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"
