 "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I get older losing my hair\nMany years from now\nWill you still be sending me a valentine\nBirthday greetings, bottle of wine?\nIf I'd been out till quarter to three\nWould you lock the door\nWill you still need me, will you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n\n[Bridge 1]\nYou'll be older too\nAnd if you say the word\nI could stay with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could be handy mending a fuse\nWhen your lights have gone\nYou can knit a sweater by the fireside\nSunday mornings go for a ride\nDoing the garden, digging the weeds\nWho could ask for more?\nWill you still need me, will you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n[Bridge 2]\nEvery summer we can rent a cottage\nIn the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear\nWe shall scrimp and save\nGrandchildren on your knee\nVera, Chuck, and Dave\n\n[Verse 3]\nSend me a postcard, drop me a line\nStating point of view\nIndicate precisely what you mean to say\nYours sincerely, wasting away\nGive me your answer, fill in a form\nMine for evermore\nWill you still need me, will you still feed me\nWhen I'm sixty-four?\n\n[Outro]\nWhoo!7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
