                "This simile echoes Chapter 11, Verse 12 of the Bhagavad Gita that says \u201cIf a thousand suns were to blaze forth together in the sky, they would not match the splendor of that great form [mah\u0101tmana\u1e25].\u201d\n\n Chapter 11 is also known as the Vishvarupa\u2013Darshana yoga or The Yoga of the Vision of the Cosmic Form and in it Lord Krishna shows his \u2018cosmic form\u2019 to his disciple Arjuna. Rather than a person, Krishna is revealed to be omnipresent \u201cinfinite Lord whose face is everywhere\u201d (verse 11), One (eka-stham \u2013 in one place; verse 13), and possessed of a splendor or awesome effulgence (bhah, verse 12) that would outshine a thousand suns.\n\nIn response, Arjuna bows his head in prayerful obeisance (pra\u1e47amya, verse 14), perhaps this also finds echoes in the song\u2019s closing phrase, \u201cJai Guru Deva\u201d, is a universal Hindu blessing https://thomknoles.com/uncategorized/what-does-jai-guru-deva-mean/ e"

                "This stands for the memories of good times Lennon has had in his life. The ringing could mean that it no longer is there and only acts as an echo because this was during the time the Beatles were drifting apart. Still, the lyric says that Lennon looks back fondly on his past."

                "Emotions play a pivotal role in Lennon\u2019s life \u2013 particularly at this stage. He has much to be joyful about, such as his blossoming relationship with Yoko Ono, as well as much to be sorrowful about, including the death of Brain Epstein, tensions with his band mates, and the painful memories that would lead to him taking Primal Scream Therapy.\n\nThis line also continues a pattern of comparing intangible concepts to water. Words are rain, sorrow is pools, and joy is waves.\n\nPerhaps the pools indicate that Lennon\u2019s sorrow was a constant lingering presence in his life, whilst the more dramatic waves of happiness hit him hard but soon passed."

                "Another play on words as Lennon continues the idea of vision through the second verse. He begins by saying that light dances like a million eyes. The word \u201cblindly\u201d is a play on the idea of vision he continues through verse two.  Lennon is saying that he/people search for the truth and meaning of life, (which is associated with vision and \u201copening your eyes\u201d to find truth/enlightenment) throughout the entire universe. Their thoughts meander blindly, (which means they haven\u2019t been opened yet and haven\u2019t found the meaning of life) throughout the entire universe trying to find the truth."

She must have been going on and on about something and she\u2019d gone to sleep and I\u2019d kept hearing these words over and over, flowing like an endless stream. I went downstairs and it turned into sort of a cosmic song rather than an irritated song\u2026\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t own it, you know; it came through like that. I don\u2019t know where it came from, what meter it\u2019s in, and I\u2019ve sat down and looked at it and said, \u2018Can I write another one with this meter?\u2019 It\u2019s so interesting: \u2018Words are flying [sic] out like [sings] endless rain into a paper cup, they slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.\u2019\n\n\u2013John Lennon (from All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, by David Sheff)\n\nThis story of late-night inspiration is similar to how Lennon wrote \u201cIn My Life\u201d and \u201cNowhere Man.\u201d"

Without the structure and patterns provided by his logic based brain, all of life would just appear as images of broken light. After all, visible light is created by refracted photons.  But with said structure and patterns, he can view wonders like the night sky."

Literally it approximates as \u201cglory to the shining remover of darkness,\u201d and can be paraphrased as \u201cvictory to God divine\u201d, \u201chail to the divine guru\u201d, or the phrase commonly invoked by the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in referring to his spiritual teacher \u201cAll Glory to Guru Dev\u201d."
