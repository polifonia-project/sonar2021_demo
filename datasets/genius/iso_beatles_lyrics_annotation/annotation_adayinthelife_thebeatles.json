                "On February 10, 1967, The Beatles entered Abbey Road Studios with George Martin and a 40-piece orchestra to record the final 24 bars to their magnum opus. When Martin asked John Lennon what he envisioned for the outro, Lennon replied:\n\nI want it to be like a musical orgasm\u2026 What I\u2019d like to hear is a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world.\n\nIn order to accomplish this, Paul McCartney set out to do the following:\n\n\nI [wrote], at the beginning of the twenty-four bars, the lowest possible note for each of the instruments in the orchestra. At the end of the twenty-four bars, I wrote the highest note each instrument could reach that was near a chord of E major. Then I put a squiggly line right through the twenty-four bars, with reference points to tell them roughly what note they should have reached during each bar. The musicians also had instructions to slide as gracefully as possible between one note and the next.\n\nIn addition to [these] extraordinary [\u2026] musical gymnastics, I told them that they were to disobey the most fundamental rule of the orchestra\u2014They were not to listen to their neighbours. A well-schooled orchestra plays, ideally, like one man, following the leader. I emphasised that this was exactly what they must not do. I told them \u2018I want everyone to be individual. It\u2019s every man for himself.\u2019\n\n\nThe result is thirty-four seconds of pure genius\u2014a crescendo hitherto unparalleled in popular music, and certainly unrivaled since. History With The Beatles recalls an ecstatic ensemble breaking out into spontaneous applause following initial playback of the take.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/usNsCeOV4GM?t=3m43s\n\nThe iconic final chord (struck at the 4:20 mark) was over-dubbed on February 22, 1967. This session was much more intimate; with George Martin present, as well as John, Paul, Ringo, trusted roadie Mal Evans, and the equally-reliable Geoff Emerick\u2014Martin\u2019s right-hand engineer. It is unclear why George Harrison wasn\u2019t present.\n\nThe goal was to provide some contrast to the tumultuous symphonic surge, with a powerful-yet-singular closing soundscape that served as the aftermath of a sonic apocalypse. This was achieved within nine takes, using two grand pianos and one upright (Martin would later overdub his own contribution via harmonium). The three Beatles and Mal Evans were tasked with punching-in an array of E major chords at the exact same time. Geoff Emerick controlled the mixing board in Abbey Road\u2019s Studio Two while they gathered around the keys. With Paul leading the group, they diligently plugged away, settling for nothing less than perfection.\n\nFollowing a count of three, all four players simultaneously held their separate E major chords at different ends of the piano, delivering the widest possible range of notes within the key signature. In order to capture the longest possible sustain, Emerick set the input at the lowest setting necessary during the downstroke, manually raising the fader to its zenith over the span of a minute\u2014while the the others \u201ckept as quiet as proverbial church mice,\u201d according to Martin. The mic-setting\u2019s conclusive input was so highly-sensitive that the tape retained sounds of the mixing board\u2019s inner-components coupled with the building\u2019s air conditioning units, resulting in a mysterious hiss that can be heard as the track fades to silence.\n\n\n\nThe Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, by famed Beatles-biographer Mark Lewisohn, cites the seventh take as the longest (at fifty-nine seconds) while the ninth take was considered to be \u201cthe best.\u201d These tracks were painstakingly layered with Martin\u2019s harmonium onto a four-track machine. The process was so arduous\u2014with technical difficulties plaguing their ability to produce a final mix\u2014that The Beatles called it a night, only to return the next day. Eventually, three mixes were compiled (dubbed \u2018remixes 10-12\u2019\u2014since they consisted of combinations of the best takes from the previous 1-9). \u2018Mix 12\u2019 was spliced with the now-famous closing chord (dubbed \u2018edit piece 9\u2019) and the rest is history."

When the recording for the song began, the Beatles did not know that they would fill those bars with the song\u2019s dramatic orchestral crescendos, just that they\u2019d have to fill them with something. \u201cIt was just a period of time, an arbitrary length of bars, which was very [John] Cage thinking,\u201d McCartney continued. But not so arbitrary \u2013 the song is a \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d after all, and there are 24 bars \u2013 same amount of hours in a day. \u201cWe got Mal Evans to count each bar,\u201d George Martin said, \u201cand on the record you can still hear his voice as he stood by the piano counting: \u2018One-two-three-four\u2026\u2019 For a joke, Mal set an alarm clock to go off at the end of 24 bars, and you can hear that too. We left it on because we couldn\u2019t get it off!\u201d The joke of an alarm clock became a brilliant use of aleatoric sound, triggering McCartney\u2019s \u201cwoke up, got out of bed\u201d section perfectly."
