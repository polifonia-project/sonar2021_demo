In her own words:\n\nOne day I picked John up in a taxi and took him to Abbey Road for a recording session. The tune to the song \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d was in his head, the words scrawled on a birthday card from a fan to his little son Julian: \u201cWhen I get home to you,\u201d it said, \u201cI find my tiredness is through\u2026\u201d \u201cRather a feeble line about tiredness\u201d, I said. \u201cOK,\u201d he said cheerfully and, borrowing my pen, instantly changed it to the slightly suggestive: \u201cWhen I get home to you/I find the things that you do/Will make me feel all right.\u201d\n\n\n\nApparently John was writing the song right there in the taxi on his son Julian\u2019s first birthday card. The birthday card is on display in the British Library."

Early in their career they started taking Preludin (An anti-narcoleptic drug that is rarely prescribed today) to help them stay awake and energized.\n\n\n\nThis infamous picture of the Beatles and the Preludin that fueled many creative nights was a source of mild controversy.\nThis picture had been taken in 1962 at \u201cThe Star Club\u201d by a man named Manfred Weissleder; fearing backlash from the media over an image with drugs in it, Beatles manager Brian Epstein asked him to not release the photographs to any form of media, luckily his words were heeded and the photo wasn\u2019t released until 13 years later in 1975, if the photo had been released earlier on, it could have been harmful to their career."
