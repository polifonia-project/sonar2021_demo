                "It is likely this song was inspired by Paul\u2019s girlfriend at the time Jane Asher, since it was recorded in the basement of her parents house.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if John worked on that at all\u2026 The middle eight is mine. I would say that John probably helped with the middle eight, but he can\u2019t say \u2018It\u2019s mine\u2019. I wrote this on my own. I can actually see Margaret Asher\u2019s upstairs drawing room. I remember playing it there, not writing it necessarily."

                "The change-up that occurs here was written before the very eyes of music publisher Dick James:\n\nThey were laying down the tracks and doing the melody lines of the song And I Love Her. It was a very simple song and quite repetitive. George Martin and I looked at each other and the same thought sparked off in both of our minds. It was proving to be, although plain and a warm and sympathetic song, just too repetitive, with the same phrase of repeating. George Martin told the boys, \u2018Both Dick and I feel that the song is just lacking the middle. It\u2019s too repetitive, and it needs something to break it up.\u2019 I think it was John who shouted, \u2018OK, let\u2019s have a tea break\u2019, and John and Paul went to the piano and, while Mal Evans was getting tea and some sandwiches, the boys worked at the piano. Within half an hour they wrote, there before our very eyes, a very constructive middle to a very commercial song. Although we know it isn\u2019t long, it\u2019s only a four bar middle, nevertheless it was just the right ingredients to break up the over repetitive effect of the original melody.\n\nThis was the keen musical direction that George Martin provided for the Beatles. It would have been a beautiful song regardless of the change-up, but it definitely preps the ear for the guitar solo."

                "This woman gives McCartney everything he desires with tenderness; implying that she is neither headstrong nor withdrawn, but the perfect amalgamation of both (i.e. the perfect woman).\n\n McCartney further brags about her lover\u2019s loyalty to him stating that when she kisses, he is the sole receiver of them."

                "This was McCartney\u2019s first Ballad of his that he was really proud to have written:\n\nIt was the first ballad I impressed myself with. It\u2019s got nice chords in it, \u2018Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky\u2026\u2019 I like the imagery of the stars and the sky. It was a love song really. The \u2018And\u2019 in the title was an important thing. \u2018And I Love Her,\u2019 it came right out of left field, you were right up to speed the minute you heard it. The title comes in the second verse and it doesn\u2019t repeat. You would often go to town on the title, but this was almost an aside, \u2018Oh\u2026 and I love you.\u2019 It still holds up and George played really good guitar on it. It worked very well.\n-Paul McCartney"
