It is also likely that the oblique lyrics were an attempt at writing something akin to the wordplay of Bob Dylan, whose songs Lennon greatly admired.\n\n\n\nThe song could also be a reference to a press release about a Frank Sinatra TV show for people who were \u201ctired of kid singers wearing mops of hair thick enough to hide a crate of melons.\u201d The Beatles were known for their mop tops. Anyone who dismissed them in this way couldn\u2019t appreciate the great music that The Beatles were making.\n\n\n\nLennon was later dismissive of And Your Bird Can Sing, describing it as \u201ca horror\u201d and \u201cthrowaway\u201d. Paul McCartney claims to have helped Lennon write the song.\n\nAnd Your Bird Can Sing was John\u2019s song. I suspect that I helped with the verses because the songs were nearly always written without second and third verses. I seem to remember working on that middle eight with him but it\u2019s John\u2019s song, 80-20 to John.\n-Paul McCartney"
