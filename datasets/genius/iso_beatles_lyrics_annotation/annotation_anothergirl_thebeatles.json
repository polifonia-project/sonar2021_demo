                "It\u2019s not clear who Paul McCartney was writing about, but these lyrics became somewhat autobiographical years after this song\u2019s release.\n\nPaul met Jane Asher on April 18, 1963, when the Beatles performed in London. The two announced their engagement in December of 1967. The engagement was short lived, however, ending in the summer of 1968 when Asher walked in on Paul in bed with another woman named Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Schwartz' relationship was only a summer fling and never amounted to anything serious as he ended up marrying his first wife, Linda Eastman, in May of 1969."
