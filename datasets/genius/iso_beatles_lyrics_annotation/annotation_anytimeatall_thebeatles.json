                "These lyrics are quite similar to the classic 1960 Ben E. King song \u201cStand By Me\u201d\n\nWhen the night has come\nAnd the land is dark\nAnd the moon is the only light we\u2019ll see\nNo I won\u2019t be afraid, no I won\u2019t be afraid\nJust as long as you stand, stand by me\n\n\n\nJohn later did an excellent cover of \u201cStand By Me \u201d"

                "This was derivative of another tune John had hatched around the same time:\n\nAn effort at writing It Won\u2019t Be Long \u2013 same ilk: C to A minor, C to A minor \u2013 with me shouting.\n\nIn this song John offers his time, sympathy, and patience. Quite different than his stance in songs like \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Cry Instead\u201d, and its certainly contradicts how busy he seems to be in \u201cWhen I Get Home\u201d"

Paul suggested they just use a Piano composition, and the album was released with an unfinished song, simply because they hit their deadline. It certainly didn\u2019t hurt the albums success at all! Ultimately selling over 4,000,000 copies in the United States!"
