                "Although a cover, this song does feature several key, subtle features of the expert Beatles songwriting. The tempo change leaps from a slow waltz in the verses to a straight 4/4 in the bridges, and the chord structure flirts with major and minor keys simultaneously.\n\nIt starts on F#m, but instead of moving to the natural Bm, it instead moves to B major, creating a sense of lift.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it ends on a singular F# major chord that stands out from the minor melody of the song before it. This is a common trope of Beatle songwriting known as a Picardy Third also heard in Lennon\u2019s I\u2019ll Be Back."

                "The Beatles recorded five live takes of this song at approximately 2:45pm on 11th February 1963. Two overdubs were then added for vocals. This song is the only McCartney number on the album to feature double-tracked vocals."

                "Paul McCartney said of it:\n\nA Taste Of Honey was one of my big numbers in Hamburg \u2013 a bit of a ballad. It was different, but it used to get requested a lot. We sang close harmonies on the little echo mikes, and we made a fairly good job of it. It used to sound pretty good, actually."

                "The film version of A Taste Of Honey was based on Shelagh Delaney\u2019s first play, written when she was a teenager.\n\n\n\nMcCartney loved the film\u2019s theme tune, his classical pop sensibilities aroused by wholesome tunes such as this. Similar songs that would come to be performed by him include Till There Was You and For No One."
