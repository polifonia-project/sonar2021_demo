I hope you can hear me. I\u2019d be awfully disappointed if you couldn\u2019t. We\u2019d like to do another one from, er, one of our LPs, albums, long players, records\u2026. (Oh, you\u2019re okay, are you?) It\u2019s a slow number, and it\u2019s a waltz for all of you over ten. (I can see you, Paul!) Some people play fast waltzes, and some people play slow waltzes. But we\u2019re going to play a slow one, and it\u2019s called \u201cBaby\u2019s in Black\u201d"
