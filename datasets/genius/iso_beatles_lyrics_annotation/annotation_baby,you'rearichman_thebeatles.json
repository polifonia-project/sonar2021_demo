                "It has been alleged that this line in \u201cBaby You\u2019re A Rich Man\u201d is actually a homophobic slur aimed at The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein.\n\nAs claimed by some, the lyrics are actually a dig at Epstein made by Lennon, fuelled by the fact that their manager was supposedly mishandling the band\u2019s money. Due to this, as Epstein was both Jewish and a homosexual, it was believed that the lyrics \u201cman\u201d and \u201ctoo\u201d were switched to be rather offensive words.\n\nIn fact, Lennon and Epstein had actually been to Spain together in the early 1960s, and this was the subject of much deliberation as to whether Lennon, himself, was having an affair with The Beatles' manager. They had supposedly spent some \u2018private\u2019 time in Epstein\u2019s bedroom in Spain (as pictured below)."

                "In a profit-oriented world, individual wealth is often considered a sign of one\u2019s beauty.\n\nThe inspiration for John\u2019s lyrics in \u201cBaby You\u2019re a Rich Man\u201d is a debated topic amongst Beatles scholars and fans. Ian McDonald, in his book Revolution In The Head, asserts that:\n\nThe \u2018beautiful people\u2019 was what the West Coast hippies called themselves.  The \u201814-Hour Technicolor Dream,\u2019 an all-night festival at Alexandra Palace on April 29th, 1967 which Lennon attended, was the first tribal gathering of the British \u2018beautiful people.\u2019  This, and the fact that the session for \u2018Baby, You\u2019re A Rich Man\u2019 was arranged at short notice, suggest that the song was inspired by the event.\n\n\n\nA Newsweek article on the death of longtime Beatles' manager Brian Epstein (who died from a drug overdose seven weeks after the song was released) suggests that the \u201cbeautiful people\u201d idea originated from George Harrison\u2019s claim that \u201cthe song touted an uplifting, Eastern-tinged message: the idea that anyone can be \"rich\u201d because richness comes from within.\u201c Rolling Stone magazine, echoes a similar altruistic view, claiming that:\n\nThe title came from McCartney, but the spirit was pure Lennon. The working-class hero loved nothing better than tweaking the moneyed class: \u201cThe point was, stop moaning \u2014 you\u2019re a rich man, and we\u2019re all rich men, heh heh, baby!\u201d he said. When Lennon sang, \u201cHow does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?\u201d he was talking to himself.\n\nYet, the warmth suggested by these interpretations is blunted by sources claiming that John\u2019s lyrics in \u201cBaby You\u2019re a Rich Man\u201d  represent his dissatisfaction with the increasingly distressed attitude of Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. This theory is supported by allegations that Lennon sang \u201cbaby you\u2019re a rich fag jew\u201d in the studio.\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/cdn/manifest/video/x45vp02.m3u8?auth=1511960701-2688-fxrq9n0m-9ce9cddc0e3dedc12caea4d7e6d0d48e"
