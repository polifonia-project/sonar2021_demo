However, disconnecting it would disconnect the link to the listener \u2013 concealable battery-powered wireless transmitters weren\u2019t developed yet.\nBecause the USSR was an adversary of Britain (the Beatles were British!), they might\u2019ve wiretapped the telephone in their hotel room."

Although in many ways a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khrushchev, Brezhnev promptly ended the reforms; and, among other things, approved the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, at the time The Beatles recorded the song.\n\n\n\nAbove: Brezhnev\u2019s \u2018Blue Steel\u2019 look\n\nAs for the rest of the world, for The Beatles, the change must have been palpable: Perhaps that\u2019s why the narrator hardly recognizes the place anymore."
