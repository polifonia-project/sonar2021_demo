                "John Lennon, the writer of this song, was a big fan of the American Blues music, an American genre with African roots based on melancholy and sadness. The Beatles were accused of ripping them off at times but Lennon said that:\n\nthe one thing we always did was to make it known that these were black originals, we loved the music and wanted to spread it in any way we could. in the \u201850s there were few people listening to blues \u2013 R + B \u2013 rock and roll, in America as well as Britain. People like \u2013 Eric Burdons Animals \u2013 Micks Stones \u2013 and us drank ate and slept the music, and also recorded it, many kids were turned on to black music by us.\n-John Lennon\n\n\n\nThe color blue is generally associated with sadness in the English language.\n\nHe was feeling blue\n\nThis is because blue was related to rain, or storms, and in Greek mythology, the god Zeus would make rain when he was sad (crying), and a storm when he was angry. Kyanos was a name used in Ancient Greek to refer to dark blue tile (in English it means blue-green or cyan). The phrase \u201cfeeling blue\u201d is linked also to a custom among many old deepwater sailing ships. If the ship lost the captain or any of the officers during its voyage, she would fly blue flags and have a blue band painted along her entire hull when returning to home port."

                "The vocal harmonies are one of the most distinctive aspects of the much-admired \u201cBecause\u201d. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison sang together, and overdubbed their voices twice more, giving the effect of nine voices.\n\nJohn wrote this tune. The backing is a bit like Beethoven. And three-part harmony right throughout. Paul usually writes the sweeter tunes, and John writes the, sort of, more the rave-up things, or the freakier things. But John\u2019s getting to where he doesn\u2019t want to. He just wants to write twelve-bars. But you can\u2019t deny it, I think this is possibly my favourite one on the album. The lyrics are so simple. The harmony was pretty difficult to sing. We had to really learn it. But I think that\u2019s one of the tunes that will impress most people. It\u2019s really good.\n-George Harrison\n\n\n\nThe vocal harmonies, isolated from their instrumental backing, can be heard on both Anthology 3 and Love. The Love album, however, features the sound of birds twittering in the background.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind betting Yoko was in on the writing of that, it\u2019s rather her kind of writing: wind, sky and earth are recurring, it\u2019s straight out of Grapefruit and John was heavily influenced by her at the time.\n-Paul McCartney\n\nThe instrumentation on \u201cBecause\u201d was simple, with arpeggio accompaniment on harpsichord, guitar and Moog. Paul McCartney later bought the electric harpsichord, played here by George Martin, when EMI were reducing their instrument collection; it remains in his recording studio."
