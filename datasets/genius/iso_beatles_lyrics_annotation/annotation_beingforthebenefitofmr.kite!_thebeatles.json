Now, there were all kinds of stories about Henry the Horse being heroin. I had never seen heroin in that period. No, it\u2019s all just from that poster.\u201d\n\nPerhaps John chose the name Henry because of the Henderson\u2019s manager Henry Hengler.

So I got hold of old calliope tapes, playing Stars And Stripes Forever and other Sousa marches, chopped the tapes up into small sections and had Geoff Emerick throw them up in the air, re-assembling them at random.\u201d"

I had to write because it was time to write. And I had to write it quick because otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been on the album. So I had to knock off a few songs. I knocked off A Day In The Life, or my section of it, and whatever we were talking about, Mr Kite, or something like that. I was very paranoid in those days, I could hardly move.\u201d\n\nBut Paul McCartney sets us straight on what really happened in a 2013 interview:\n\n \u201cI read, occasionally, people say, \u2018Oh, John wrote that one.\u2019 I say, \u2018Wait a minute, what was that afternoon I spent with him, then, looking at this poster?\u2019 He happened to have a poster in his living room at home. I was out at his house, and we just got this idea, because the poster said \u2018Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\u2019 \u2013 and then we put in, you know, \u2018there will be a show tonight,\u2019 and then it was like, \u2018of course,\u2019\u2026The song just wrote itself.
