                "Despite Paul McCartney\u2019s optimism, flying with a broken wing, or seeing with sunken eyes, is very difficult. Ending segregation was important, but it didn\u2019t provide African Americans with equality\u2014their circumstances were still much worse than those of their white counterparts.\n\nToday, compared to white citizens, African Americans are less likely to own their own home, more likely to go to prison, and will earn less money on average. Ending segregation alone has not led to equality."

It\u2019s not really about a blackbird whose wings are broken, you know, it\u2019s a bit more symbolic.\n\n\u2013Paul McCartney in 2002"

                "McCartney is paying homage to the civil rights movement. Throughout American history, African-Americans had been seeking an equal place in society, and the \u201860s civil rights movements finally ended explicit government-sanctioned racism.\n\nI had in mind a black woman, rather than a bird. Those were the days of the civil rights movement, which all of us cared passionately about, so this was really a song from me to a black woman, experiencing these problems in the States: \u2018Let me encourage you to keep trying, to keep your faith, there is hope.\u2019 As is often the case with my things, a veiling took place so, rather than say \u2018Black woman living in Little Rock\u2019 and be very specific, she became a bird, became symbolic, so you could apply it to your particular problem.\n- Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now by Barry Miles"
