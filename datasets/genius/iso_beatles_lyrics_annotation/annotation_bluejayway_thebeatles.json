                "Blue Jay Way overlooks the Sunset Strip.  A few months before George wrote this song, in November 1966, Sunset Strip suffered a long series of riots and confrontations, as the police attempted to enforce a curfew.  Sunset Strip was heavily policed for the next several years, as minor confrontations continued."

                "This song was written by George Harrison while he was waiting for The Beatles' publicist Derek Taylor, who was lost in fog in the Los Angeles canyons.\n\nThe song was composed in the Hollywood hills on 1 August 1967. Harrison was visiting California with his wife Pattie, plus Neil Aspinall and Alexis Mardas. They were staying at a rented house in Blue Jay Way, high in the Hollywood hills.\n\n\n\nBecause of their locations in low basins surrounded by mountains, Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley are notorious for their smog. The millions of vehicles in these regions combined with the additional effects of the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles/Long Beach port complexes frequently contribute to further air pollution which continues to be an issue to this day."

                "Harrison has been up all night waiting for his friends who clearly aren\u2019t coming and it\u2019s so late that the sun is rising again. He wants to go to bed but he can\u2019t because he still thinks they might turn up.\n\nThe name of the song comes from a street located high in the Hollywood Hills overlooking Sunset Boulevard where George Harrison rented a house at Blue Jay Way during August 1967.  Blue Jay Way is in a hilly neighborhood north of Sunset Strip, in which almost all the streets are named after birds.  The home affords panoramic views of Hollywood and much of the Los Angeles Basin."
