                "According to Beatlesbible.com, Can\u2019t Buy Me Love is the first of the Fab Four\u2019s singles to only feature one singer. Written by Paul, originally there were backing vocals that would be heard here and throughout the song done by John and George but they were thrown out after the band simply determined they didn\u2019t need them. The next single released with only one singer, no backing vocals, would be Things We Said Today later that same year. Overall, there are 5 singles that feature the voice of only one Beatle. They are Can\u2019t Buy Me Love, Things We Said Today, She\u2019s a Woman, Strawberry Fields Forever and Revolution.\n\nThe version of Can\u2019t Buy Me Love with the backing vocals can be heard on the Anthology 1 album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS0Tf7fY4xw"

                "The line has been dissected and used over and over again, so this is not a surprise to find it almost verbally copied by American rocker Eddie Money in his 1978 hit Baby Hold on \u2013\n\nThat money can\u2019t buy you love\n\nAnd even more, in the same song\n\nI\u2019m gonna give you all I got"

                "Interestingly enough this song has a little portion that features a drummer different than Ringo. As audio engineer Geoff Emerick recalls:\n\nPerhaps because it had been spooled incorrectly, the tape had a ripple in it, resulting in the intermittent loss of treble on Ringo\u2018s hi-hat cymbal. There was tremendous time pressure to get the track mixed and delivered to the pressing plant, and due to touring commitments the Beatles themselves were unavailable, so George and Norman took it upon themselves to make a little adjustment\u2026. Thanks to Norman\u2019s considerable skills as a drummer, the repair was made quickly and seamlessly.\n\n\n\n(Norman Smith in picture)"

                "Paul was always approaching songs from a technical standpoint (not to say his heart wasn\u2019t in it), many of his songs came from the desire to \u201cTry out something new\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t Buy Me Love is my attempt to write a bluesy mode. The idea behind it was that all these material possessions are all very well but they won\u2019t buy me what I really want. It was a very hooky song. Ella Fitzgerald later did a version of it which I was very honoured by.\n\nThis is one of the few songs on the album that was written solely by Paul.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H18gxFbmgE"

                "Some have suggested that this song is about a man trying to court a prostitute, however Paul McCartney despises that interpretation and states there is no validity whatsoever in the claim.\n\nPersonally, I think you can put any interpretation you want on anything, but when someone suggest\u2019s that Can\u2019t Buy Me Love is about a prostitute, I draw the line. That\u2019s going too far.\n\nPaul is a stand up gentleman, he has been knighted by the queen of England! It\u2019s very unlikely he would visit a mistress of the night."

                "This line became quite ironic as Paul McCartney accumulated his vast 1.2 Billion dollar fortune.\n\n\n\nMaybe there is a little wisdom to be picked up from that, if you chase what you love and not money, money is bound to find you."
