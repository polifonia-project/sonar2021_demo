                "The arpeggiated guitar motif from the end of \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d reappears toward the end of this song, acting as a bridge into \u201cThe End\u201d. McCartney\u2019s weaving of elements from other songs in the Abbey Road medley gave a sense of continuity and completeness which would otherwise have been absent."

                "The melody from \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d is reprised here on brass instruments, followed by a short guitar line, and finally leads to McCartney singing the melody with different lyrics. This is the song\u2019s only vocal passage without the other Beatles, although it was double-tracked to give harmonies."

                "One of the album\u2019s last entreatments is love in a sexual manner. It is never requested by the singer; it is only invited. This illustrates a distance between the two partners; the two do not share desire, but instead it is an invitation and reception. Dissolution of the individual happens in the \u201cmiddle of the celebrations,\u201d causing a breakdown of the individuation between partners.\n\nThis could be used to discuss The Beatles as they approach their finality; Paul cannot force the band to stay together, as he attempted through the Let It Be period, but rather must accept that he can only request their staying.\n\nWhen he fails, boy, he\u2019s gonna carry that weight. They all are."

                "\u201cCarry That Weight\u201d was written by Paul McCartney as part of Abbey Road\u2019s long medley recorded along with Golden Slumbers,.\n\nIt refers to the troubles they were having, both within the group and in their business dealings at Apple.\n\nI\u2019m generally quite upbeat but at certain times things get to me so much that I just can\u2019t be upbeat any more and that was one of the times. We were taking so much acid and doing so much drugs and all this Klein shit was going on and getting crazier and crazier and crazier. Carry that weight a long time: like for ever! That\u2019s what I meant.\n-Paul McCartney"

                "One of the few songs where all four Beatles sang harmony. However, Lennon was injured in a car accident with his wife (Ono got it worse, reportedly had a bed brought into the studio when Lennon was feeling well enough to record). Thus, it was only McCartney, Starr, and Harrison who recorded the initial harmony before Lennon added his part."
