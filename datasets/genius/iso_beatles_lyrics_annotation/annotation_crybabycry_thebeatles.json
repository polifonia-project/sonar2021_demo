                "While a \u201cBird and Bee\u201d isn\u2019t a real thing, it seems to be a reference to a couple different things. In the context of the song it seems to be some sort of establishment, like a tavern.\n\nThe name \u201cBird and Bee\u201d sounds similar to B&B, which is short for bed and breakfast, so this could have been a play on words, written as an incorrectly unabbreviated version of B&B."

                "\u201cCry Baby Cry\u201d is followed on the album by an unrelated and unlisted track, ad-libbed and sung by Paul McCartney. Though the song has no official name, it is popularly known as \u201cCan You Take Me Back\u201d (after the primary lyric of the song).\n\nThe hidden track is an improvised jam recorded by McCartney during a 1968 session for \u201cI Will.\u201d"
