                "At the  beginning of the track the fading sound of an airplane is heard. This is part of a segue from the previous track on the White Album, Back in the U.S.S.R.\n\nThe Travis style guitar fingerpicking pattern used throughout the song was taught to John Lennon by Donovan, who was also studying with the Maharishi Yogi at the time. This distinctive picking pattern, featuring quickly alternating bass notes, was used on a number of other songs on the White Album, including Julia and Happiness Is A Warm Gun."

The Beatles have explored this idea in songs such as \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d and \u201cWithin You Without You\u201d.\n\nLennon is saying that Prudence can experience this oneness with the world while also experiencing the world itself, if only she is willing to try."

                "Prudence is a real person, Mia Farrow\u2019s younger sister, who was on a meditation retreat with the Beatles in India. She spent a lot of time indoors and had to be persuaded by John Lennon and George Harrison to come outside. Lennon later wrote this song about her.\n\nShe\u2019d been locked in for three weeks and wouldn\u2019t come out, trying to reach God quicker than anybody else. That was the competition in Maharishi\u2019s camp: who was going to get cosmic first. What I didn\u2019t know was I was already cosmic. [Laughs.]\n\n\u2013 John Lennon\n\nPrudence later confirmed she was more fanatical in her pursuit of enlightenment than those around her.\n\nBeing on that course was more important to me than anything in the world. I was very focused on getting in as much meditation as possible, so that I could gain enough experience to teach it myself. I knew that i must have stuck out because I would always rush straight back to my room after lectures and meals so that I could meditate. John, George and Paul would all want to sit around jamming and having a good time and I\u2019d be flying into my room. They were all serious about what they were doing but they just weren\u2019t as fanatical as me\u2026 At the end of the course, just as they were leaving, George mentioned that they had written a song about me but I didn\u2019t hear it until it came out on the album. I was flattered. It was a beautiful thing to have done.\n\n\u2013 Prudence Farrow\n\n\u201cThe sun is up, the sky is blue\u201d is probably a conscious echo of Buddy Holly\u2019s \u201cRaining In My Heart\u201d which begins \u201cThe sun is out, the sky is blue\u201d and also begins on a I chord with stepwise variations."
