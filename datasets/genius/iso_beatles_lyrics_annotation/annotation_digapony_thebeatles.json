                "John Lennon was a notoriously bad driver and rarely drove. Although, when he did, he drove a 1969 Honda Z50A Monkey Bike. He would drive around the Tittenhurst Park estate in Berkshire. Recently, that same bike just sold for 57,500 euros in 2018 and is now in the National Motorcycle Museum in Solihull.\n\n\n\nIt is ironic if you ask me. He is saying he is a crazy driver, but in reality, he is definitely not."

You just take words and you stick them together, and you see if they have any meaning. Some of them do and some of them don\u2019t.\n\nIn a 1980 interview, John was a little harder on himself, calling \u201cDig a Pony\u201d\n\n[a]nother piece of garbage\n\nDespite John\u2019s protestations, \u201cDig a Pony\u201d does contain various sensical allusions and references."
