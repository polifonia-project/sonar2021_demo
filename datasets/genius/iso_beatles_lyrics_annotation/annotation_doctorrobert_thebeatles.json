                "In Aldous Huxley\u2019s  Island  (1962), Dr. Robert MacPhail, whose grandfather immigrated to the Kingdom of Pala located in the Polynesian islands, mends the people under his care, mentally and physically. Dr. Robert helps to administer moksha, or a local medicinal psychedelic drug (comparable to mescaline or mushrooms or LSD) for its phsychosomatic healing properties. After the cynical protagonist, Will, of this novel takes the wonder drug at the climax of the narrative, he has a life-changing experience and declares, \u201cbelieve it or not, but now I can understand what they mean when they say \u2018god is love\u2019. What manifest nonsense. Yet it happens to be true.\u201d For evidence that the Beatles were aware of Huxley\u2019s writings on LSD, look no further than the Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Heartclub Band \n\n\n\n (1967) collage, which includes a photo cut-out of the older 60s-era Huxley."

                "This could even refer to Doctor Robert MacPhail#cite_note-1), a fictional character in Island, the last book by noted LSD advocate Aldous Huxley.\n\n\n\nOne of the main themes of the novel is drug use for enlightenment and self-knowledge.\n\nThe culture of Pala is the offspring of a Scottish secular humanist medical doctor (Doctor Robert), who made a medical visit to the island in the 19th century and decided to stay and work with its Raja, who embodies the island\u2019s Mahayana Buddhist tradition, to create a society that merges the best of East and West. The Old Raja\u2019s treatise, Notes on What\u2019s What, is a book within the book that explains Pala\u2019s philosophical foundations.\n\n\n\nThe Beatles\u2018 story is inextricably linked with drugs. From their early pre-fame days on Benzedrine and Preludin, to the flower-power era of LSD, and onto harder drugs as the 1960s ended."

In an interview with Barry Miles, Paul said that they just found the idea of the Doctor humorous.\n\nJohn and I thought it was a funny idea: the fantasy doctor who would fix you up by giving you drugs, [the song] was a parody on that idea. It\u2019s just a piss-take."
