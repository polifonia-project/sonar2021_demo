                "This song was written by John Lennon alone, in Brian Epstein\u2019s old Liverpool flat (which he used for his homosexual trysts to keep it hidden from his family). He later gave it to Lennon and his first wife as a wedding present and it became their maritial home. Lennon said:\n\nI was in the first apartment I\u2019d ever had that wasn\u2019t shared with fourteen other students \u2013 gals and guys at art school. I\u2019d just married Cyn, and Brian Epstein gave us his secret little apartment that he kept in Liverpool for his sexual liaisons separate from his home life. And he let Cyn and I have that apartment."

                "The Beatles recorded at least seven takes of this song on 11th February 1963, and take six was chosen for the album cut.\n\nHarrison said of his contribution:\n\n[That song] was \u2018my song\u2019 on the album. I didn\u2019t like my vocal on it. I didn\u2019t know how to sing, nobody told me how to.\n\nIt also fit Harrison\u2019s image as the quiet, young doo-wop child of the group. McCartney and Lennon reinforce this style with some simple doo-wop backing vocals overdubbed after the live takes."

                "Lennon was inspired to write this song after the Disney tune Wishing Well, from the movie Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs, which his mother Julia would often sing to him:\n\nMy mother was\u2026 a comedienne and a singer. Not professional, but, you know, she used to get up in pubs and things like that. She had a good voice. She could do Kay Starr. She used to do this little tune when I was just a one or two year old\u2026 yeah, she was still living with me then\u2026 The tune was from the Disney movie \u2013 \u2018Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell. You are standing by a wishing well.\u2019\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hpWF0xx6vk"

                "Lennon and McCartney would often write tracks with George or Ringo in mind, and would tailor their vocal melodies if they thought it would be a good fit for one of their colleagues.\n\nGeorge had yet to develop his own melodic voice, and Ringo was never a born singer, so in order to adapt Lennon-McCartney wrote deliberately simple melodies that wouldn\u2019t challenge the small ranges of Harrison and Starr. It was also a practice they used when writing With A Little Help From My Friends.\n\nLennon said:\n\nI wrote it and just gave it to George to sing. I thought it would be a good vehicle for him because it only had three notes and he wasn\u2019t the best singer in the world. He has improved a lot since then, but in those days his singing ability was very poor because (a) he hadn\u2019t had the opportunity, and (b) he concentrated more on the guitar. So I wrote that \u2013 not for him as I was writing it, but when I had written it, I thought he could do it. It was just written."
