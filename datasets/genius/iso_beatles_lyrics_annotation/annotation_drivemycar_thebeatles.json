                "Paul McCartney recorded the solo, though usually Harrison was the lead guitarist. Paul recorded this solo in two different versions. The first one couldn\u2019t be perfectly removed by the recording, so we can faintly hear another guitar playing on the background, particularly in the end of the solo.\n\n(http://www.beatlesebooks.com/drive-my-car)"

                "This nice tongue-in-cheek idea came and suddenly there was a girl there, the heroine of the story, and the story developed and had a little sting in the tail like \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d had, which was \u2018I actually haven\u2019t got a car, but when I get one you\u2019ll be a terrific chauffeur.\u2019\n- Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now by Barry Miles"

                "Why would a Beatle want to become a chauffeur?\n\nWhen Paul declines the girl\u2019s advances, she thinks he\u2019s turning her down because he already has a steady job. \u201cPeanuts\u201d is a common idiom, meaning \u201cnext to nothing\u201d."

                "Paul McCartney\u2019s first draft of the song featured a chorus based around the line, \u201cYou can buy me golden rings\u201d. He and Lennon reworked the song with some difficulty, eventually discarding the clich\u00e9s and settling upon the idea of a headstrong woman.\n\nThe lyrics were disastrous and I knew it\u2026 This is one of the songs where John and I came nearest to having a dry session. The lyrics I brought in were something to do with golden rings, which is always fatal. \u2018Rings\u2019 is fatal anyway, \u2018rings\u2019 always rhymes with \u2018things\u2019 and I knew it was a bad idea. I came in and I said, \u2018These aren\u2019t good lyrics but it\u2019s a good tune.\u2019 The tune was nice, the tune was there, I\u2019d done the melody. Well, we tried, and John couldn\u2019t think of anything, and we tried and eventually\u2026 it became \u2018drive my car\u2019 instead of \u2018gold-en rings\u2019, and then it was wonderful.\n- Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now by Barry Miles"

                "The song contained clear sexual overtones, from the first verse\u2019s You can do something in between to the suggestive promises of a better time.\n\n\u2018Drive my car\u2019 was an old blues euphemism for sex, so in the end all is revealed. Black humour crept in and saved the day. It wrote itself then. I find that very often, once you get the good idea, things write themselves.\n-Paul McCartney"
