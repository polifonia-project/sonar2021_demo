                "The origins of the song\u2019s title have been debated for years. Many believe it was Ringo who came up with the phrase in regard to the state of their touring schedule.\n\nDuring an interview segment on the Howard Stern Show, Paul McCartney explained that it was actually said by a chauffeur who drove him around after he lost his license for speeding:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYVWvdQux4\n\nThe phrase was also used for the title of the 2016 Ron Howard documentary, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week \u2013 The Touring Years."

                "In the Queen\u2019s English, \u201cain\u2019t got nothing but\u201d is a horrifically ungrammatical construction.  And that\u2019s the point.  In this case, the construction calls to mind the 1930s jazz standard \u201cI Ain\u2019t Got Nothin' But the Blues\u201d, by Duke Ellington and Don George.\nThe early Beatles were revolutionary in the way that they combined Black American jazz & blues with English pops to produce a vigorous new form of rock & roll.  If the early Beatles sound conventional to 21st-century ears, that\u2019s just because they won their musical revolution so completely.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOAf--LjrXw"

                "The song begins with an unexpected fade-in, an early example of The Beatles and George Martin\u2019s willingness to experiment with new sound and production techniques. It was the only second time this technique appeared on a major pop recording (\u201cCome See About Me\u201d, by The Supremes was the first, released one month earlier)."
