                "These lyrics are understood to be about Lennon\u2019s escalating drug use. A \u2018monkey on your back\u2019 was 1940s jazz slang for \u201cheroin addiction\u201d\u2014which makes sense because John and Yoko started experimenting with heroin in 1968, supposedly to escape pressures from the outside world and the media."

                "Whilst Lennon never really clarified what \u201cmy monkey\u201d means, there are a few popular explanations. One is that his monkey is Yoko Ono, John\u2019s new woman who was a figure of distrust for those in and around the group at the time.\n\n\n\nOther theories suggest the monkey could represent his then escalating drug habit, which had by 1968 expanded to include copious amounts of LSD and heroin \u2013 a theory backed by Paul McCartney in an interview.\n\nGeorge Harrison claimed that the song came from a favourite saying of the Maharishi, \u201capart from that bit about the monkey\u201d."
