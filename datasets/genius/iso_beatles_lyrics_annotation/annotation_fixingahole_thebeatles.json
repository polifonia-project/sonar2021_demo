                "With the nature of how Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band was written, a good amount of songs are written about the use of drugs, this song was essentially about pot, an \u201code to pot\u201d as McCartney says.\n\nMcCartney revealed that the song was an \u201code to pot.\u201d It was actually the Beatle bassist\u2019s second song in that vein, following the marijuana tribute \u201cGot to Get You Into My Life\u201d on Revolver. He used the analogy of fixing something to represent how pot had opened his mind.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Fixing a Hole\u2019 was about all those pissy people who told you, \u2018Don\u2019t daydream, don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that.\u2019 It seemed to me that that was all wrong and that it was now time to fix all of that\u201d."

                "This song is an ode to gaining personal freedom, to having no one tell you what to do:\n\n\u201cIt was the idea of me being on my own now, able to do what I want. If I want I\u2019ll paint the room in a colourful way\u2026 I was living now pretty much on my own in Cavendish Avenue, and enjoying my freedom and my new house and the salon-ness of it all. It\u2019s pretty much my song, as I recall. I like the double meaning of \u2018If I\u2019m wrong I\u2019m right where I belong\u2019.\u201d \u2013 McCartney\n\nPersonal freedom is extremely conducive to creativity. Being in control of your environment leads to the development of your personality and art simultaneously."

                "This line is about the people who would just hang around outside wherever the Beatles were, they wouldn\u2019t introduce themselves as friends, but act more like stalkers who make themselves visible. The Beatles actually loved meeting and consorting with fans who treated them like friends, McCartney recounts one funny story of someone who DID get in his door:\n\n\u201cThe funny thing about that was the night when we were going to record it, at Regent Sound Studios at Tottenham Court Road. I brought a guy who was Jesus. A guy arrived at my front gate and I said \u2018Yes? Hello\u2019 because I always used to answer it to everyone. If they were boring I would say, \u2018Sorry, no,\u2019 and they generally went away. This guy said, \u2018I\u2019m Jesus Christ.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oop,\u2019 slightly shocked. I said, \u2018Well, you\u2019d better come in then.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Well, it probably isn\u2019t. But if he is, I\u2019m not going to be the one to turn him away\u2019. So I gave him a cup of tea and we just chatted and I asked, \u2018Why do you think you are Jesus?\u2019 There were a lot of casualties about then. We used to get a lot of people who were maybe insecure or going through emotional breakdowns or whatever. So I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go to a session but if you promise to be very quiet and just sit in a corner, you can come.\u2019 So he did, he came to the session and he did sit very quietly and I never saw him after that. I introduced him to the guys. They said, \u2018Who\u2019s this?\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s Jesus Christ.\u2019 We had a bit of a giggle over that.\u201d"

                "The cracks in the door, once again, provide a metaphor for the distractions, except this time rather than being distracted by something natural like rain, he is distracted by the fact that others can possibly see him and hear him.\n\nHe is not able to be himself knowing that he is visible to others. By \u201cfilling the cracks\u201d and allowing himself to remain out of sight, he is allowing his mind to wander and his ideas to flow more freely."

It is important for self-discovery and enlightenment to let the mind wander and go where it pleases.\n\n\n\nThere was speculation that this was about an actual hole McCartney needed to fix in his farmhouse, but Paul himself puts that idea to rest:\n\n\u201cIt was much later that I ever got round to fixing the roof on the Scottish farm; I never did any of that until I met Linda. People just make it up! They know I\u2019ve got a farm, they know it has a roof, they know I might be given to handyman tendencies so it\u2019s a very small leap for mankind\u2026 to make up the rest of the story.\u201d\n\nThe song was associated early on with negative connotations because \u201cFixing a hole\u201d was thought to be a heroin reference, when in actuality the song is another \u201cOde to pot\u201d like \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life\u201d"
