                "This line comes from the recording of \u201cToo Bad About Sorrows\u201d, a song recorded during the Get Back Sessions (eventually renamed Let It Be) that was never actually included on the final cut of the album.\n\nLennon was becoming increasingly frustrated and bored with the recording of the song, and exclaimed the line out of sheer procrastination.\n\nProducer Phil Spector had engineered a loop using the song\u2019s instrumental break, over which he inserted snippets of speech from the Let It Be film soundtrack. However, he ended up discarding this idea completely, leaving only this piece of Lennon dialogue.\n\nAcclaimed Beatles biographer, Mark Lewisohn, acknowledges in his piece The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions that this technique was common in the rough mixes for the track:\n\nSeveral mixes were made in this fashion, utilising such cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 moments from the rooftop performance element of the film as the old woman\u2019s \u201cI just can\u2019t see that it makes sense!\u201d, the young girl\u2019s \u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s great\u2026 livens up the office hours, anyway\u201d, the bowler-hatted vicar\u2019s \u201cNice to have something for free in this country at the moment, isn\u2019t it?\u201d, the taxi driver\u2019s \u201cIs it their new record? Oh, great, I\u2019m all in favour of it!\u201d and the pompous businessman\u2019s \u201cThis type of music is all right in its place, it\u2019s quite enjoyable. But I think it\u2019s a bit of an imposition to absolutely disrupt all the business in this area\u2026\u201d\n\nWhilst \u201cToo Bad About Sorrows\u201d as a whole was not included on the final album, this part of it is the only piece of music recorded at Twickenham Film Studios, as well as the only part of the song, to be included on the record.\n\n\n\nThe Beatles recording Get Back at Twickenham"

George is trying to encourage Lennon, who was aware of his limitations on the instrument and would have preferred Harrison to play it.\n\nOf course, Lennon has the same first name as Goode\u2026 which would cause Berry to make a cringeworthy pun when the two of them performed \u201cJohnny B.

                "Elmore James was an American blues guitarist, particularly known for his slide guitar playing.\n\n\n\nUnusually, John Lennon played slide guitar on this track. Normally, Harrison would play lead and slide guitar parts for the Beatles. Harrison shouted this to encourage Lennon by comparing him to an iconic slide guitar player.\n\nHarrison was increasingly becoming known for his slide playing. Whilst his encouragement to Lennon was very generous, by the time of his death, Harrison was as good as anyone at playing slide guitar:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4I4KvFu9_I&feature=kp"
