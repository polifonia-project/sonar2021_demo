                "McCartney has never directly revealed who his inspiration for \u201cJojo\u201d was. If this song was about John Lennon and Yoko Ono (which Paul denies), Jojo could be a nickname for John. However, the name \u201cJojo\u201d could have also come from Jo Jo Laine, the wife of singer Denny Laine from the Moody Blues \u2013 later a member of Wings with McCartney.\n\nOne very likely solution to the mystery comes from this article, which suggests that Jojo in the song was actually a reference to Joseph Melville See Jr, Linda\u2019s ex-husband. Paul and Linda were close to Joseph. Linda met Joseph in Tuscon, Arizona at the University of Arizona.\n\n\n\nThis song may have been the inspiration for the title to the series Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures. In the series, all the main protagonist begin as loners, but they gain friends as the story unfolds. In the ending of part 3, the character Joseph Joestar can be seen listening to this song on his Walkman."

                "\u201cGet back to where you once belonged\u201d is McCartney\u2019s reworking of the line, \u201cGet back to where you should be,\u201d which came from a song Harrison wrote called \u201cSour Milk Sea,\u201d and was eventually recorded by Jackie Lomax in 1968, with three of the bands members lending their talents on the single.\n\nWhen this song was released, there was a high controversy because the public perceived it almost as a anti-immigration song. Paul later revealed that the song had been inspired by Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, but he insisted he was not against foreigners. It was simply a point of view he saw and went along with.\n\nJohn Lennon would later claim that this lyric was aimed at Yoko Ono, and \u2014 according to Lennon \u2014McCartney would often make sideways glances in her direction when singing this in the studio."
