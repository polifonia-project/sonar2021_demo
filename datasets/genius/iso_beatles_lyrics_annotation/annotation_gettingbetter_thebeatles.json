                "John Lennon and Paul McCartney were not very fond of teachers. A list of John\u2019s detentions from Quarry Bank High School was found in 2015. It shows many of John\u2019s actions, like \u201cno [homework]\u201c and \u201cimpertinence,\u201d as well as other disruptions from September 1955 to July 1956.\n\n\n\nAccording to Many Years From Now by Barry Miles, Paul said:\n\nThe \u2018angry young man\u2019 and all that was John and I filling in the verses about schoolteachers. We shared a lot of feelings against teachers who had punished you too much or who hadn\u2019t understood you or who had just been bastards generally.\n\n\u2013(via The Beatles Bible website)"

                "In his November 1997 biography, Many Years From Now, Paul McCartney said:\n\nI was sitting there doing, \u201cGetting better all the time,\u201d and John just said in his laconic way, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t get no worse.\u201d I thought, \u201cOh, brilliant! This is exactly why I love writing with John.\u201d\n\nThis is a typical example of McCartney and Lennon\u2019s songwriting dynamic. Lennon once said:\n\nWell, you could say that he [McCartney] provided a lightness, an optimism, while I would always go for the sadness, the discords, a certain bluesy edge."

Lennon admitted to abusing his significant other in his youth:\n\nAll that \u2018I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved\u2019 was me. I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically \u2013 any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn\u2019t express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace. Everything\u2019s the opposite. But I sincerely believe in love and peace. I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.\n\n\u2013from Lennon\u2019s final interview with Playboy in 1980"
