                "These lines closely describe a femme fatale type of girl. In Barry Miles' Beatles in Their Own Words Lennon admitted it being about a dream girl:\n\nThis was about a dream girl. When Paul and I wrote lyrics in the old days we used to laugh about it like the Tin Pan Alley people would. And it was only later on that we tried to match the lyrics to the tune. I like this one. It was one of my best.\n\nAlso, during the interview for his 1971 Rolling Stone cover story, Lennon explained that even though the girl described in the song was no girl in particular, her description would later fit Yoko Ono, whom Lennon married in 1969:\n\n[\u2026] but \u201cGirl\u201d is real. There\u2019s no such thing as the girl; she was a dream, you know, but the words are all right, you know. It\u2019s about \u201cWas she taught when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure/Did she understand it?\u201d, all that. They\u2019re sort of philosophy quotes. It was reasonable, and I was thinking about it, you know, when I wrote it; it wasn\u2019t just a song, and it was about, you know, that girl \u2014 which happened to turn out to be Yoko in the end, but the one that a lot of us were looking for, you know."

In an interview for Barry Miles' Many Years From Now McCartney commented:\n\n\nIt was always amusing to see if we could get a naughty word on the record: \u201cfish and finger pie,\u201d \u201cprick teaser,\u201d \u201ctit tit tit tit.\u201d The Beach Boys had a song out where they\u2019d done \u201cla la la la\u201d and we loved the innocence of that and wanted to copy it, but not use the same phrase. So we were looking around for another phrase, so it was \u201cdit dit dit dit\u201d, which we decided to change in our waggishness to \u201ctit tit tit tit\u201d, which is virtually indistinguishable from \u201cdit dit dit dit\u201d. And it gave us a laugh.\n\nIt was to get some light relief in the middle of this real big career that we were forging. If we could put in something that was a little bit subversive then we would. George Martin might say, \u2018Was that \u201cdit dit\u201d or \u201ctit tit\u201d you were singing?\u2019 \u2018Oh, \u201cdit dit,\u201d George, but it does sound a bit like that, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019 Then we\u2019d get in the car and break down laughing."
