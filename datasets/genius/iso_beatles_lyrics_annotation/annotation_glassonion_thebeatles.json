For increased stability on rough seas, the bottles were fashioned with a wide-bottom shape to prevent toppling, thus making the bottles look somewhat onion-shaped.\n\nThe lyrics to this song are filled with references to other Beatles songs and there are a lot of obscure lines thrown in for the sake of being red herrings.\n\nJohn Lennon wrote this song, and was not fond of critics over analyzing his lyrics (these type of critics are sometimes referred to as pseuds). The glass onion serves as a metaphor for these critics. They\u2019re looking through a glass onion trying to figure out some complex meaning behind every line in every song by The Beatles. They may think they\u2019re onto something, but really it\u2019s distorting their vision."
