                "This part of the song quotes \u201cCradle Song\u201d, a lullaby by the dramatist Thomas Dekker.\n\nPaul McCartney saw sheet music for the lullaby at his father\u2019s home in Liverpool, left on a piano by his stepsister Ruth. Unable to read music, he created his own music. However, Abbey Road does not credit Dekker with the stanza or with the title."
