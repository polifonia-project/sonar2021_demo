Due to these phrases sounding similar, and the fact that animal noises in the track begin to drown out the vocals at this point, this is often misheard as more iterations of \u201cgood morning\u201d. The vocal chart of the song in The Beatles: Rock Band confirms these lines, however.\n\nSeveral other German utterances are shouted here: \u201cja\u201d (\u201cyes\u201d) and \u201cgew\u00f6zei teuer\u201d (\u201cespecially expensive\u201d)."

So those are not just random effects, there was actually a lot of thought put into all that.\u201d\n\nThe animals you can hear in the aural stampede are: Birds, Cats, Dogs, Cows, Horses, Sheep, Lions, Elephants, and a pack of bloodhounds accompanying fox hunters.\n\nThe sound effects were taken from the \u201cAbbey Road sound effects tapes: Volume 35: Animals and Bees and Volume 57: Fox-hunt\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGdrdui3Nqg"
