                "In this line, Paul McCartney calls upon the drug habits he picked up, more specifically cannabis. Paul is no stranger when it comes to drug usage though, as he was prosecuted and had to spend nine days in a Japanese jail for possession of marijuana.\n\nCannabis was introduced to The Beatles by Bob Dylan in a New York hotel room in 1964, and McCartney recalls getting \u201cvery high\u201d and \u201cgiggling uncontrollably.\u201d\n\nHis use of the drug became habitual, and it wasn\u2019t long before he started getting into stronger drugs like LSD, which McCartney insisted did more good than harm, stating in an interview documented by Peter Brown and Steven Gaines in their book The Love You Make that:\n\nIt opened my eyes \u2026 and made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\n\n\n\n Paul and Bob Dylan Smoking"

While it\u2019s unclear when exactly he stopped, he told The Mirror in 2015 that he\u2019d stopped smoking marijuana \u201ca long time ago\u201d:\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhy? The truth is I don\u2019t really want to set an example to my kids and grandkids. It\u2019s now a parent thing.\n\n\u201cBack then I was just some guy around London having a ball, and the kids were little so I\u2019d just try and keep it out of their faces.\n\n\u201cInstead of smoking a spliff I\u2019ll now have a glass of red wine or a nice margarita. The last time I smoked was a long time ago.\u201d"
