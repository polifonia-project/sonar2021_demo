This line reinforces the safety and comfort level that he has when he is with Yoko Ono, similar to the safety that one may feel with a loaded gun. He knows that no one can take away this feeling of euphoria he ha when he is with her."

However, before the verse ended Martin inadvertantly faded the vocal part back up and the last word \u201cdown\u201d can be heard in the official version."
