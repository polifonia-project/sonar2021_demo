                "It could be possible that Paul was writing about his differences with John, but disguising it with his play on words. It is interesting to think of it that way.\n\n\n\nLife is filled with opposites,an action resulting in a reaction. This is classic pop song writing. The Beatles were very clever songwriters,the best in the business. There\u2019s a kind of magical charm to the song, the music, the melody, the play on words. About as catchy as it gets."

                "Paul has a rocky relationship with this person, when he simply goes to greet them they comically say goodbye, not even wanting to engage with whatever Paul has to say.\n\n\n\nJohn Lennon hated the song. He viewed it as an inconsequential song of McCartney\u2019s, saying it was three minutes of contradictions and meaningless juxtapositions. What further infuriated Lennon was that his I Am The Walrus, was issued as the B-side to this."

                "Paul McCartney wrote this. His friend Alistair Taylor, who was visiting McCartney, asked Paul one day how he wrote his many songs, and how he came up with his ideas.\n\n\n\nPaul took him into his dining room to give him a demonstration of his hand-carved harmonium. As an experiment, Paul asked Taylor to shout out the opposite of whatever he sang, such as black and white, yes and no, hello and goodbye, etc. From this, the song was born."
