                "When John was younger he felt like he was very confident and could cope on his own. However, now he is a big rock star, he feels the pressure of his success and is now open to the idea of opening up to people.\nJohn himself says that the song is autobiographical. He had this to say about it:\n\nWhen Help! came out, I was actually crying out for help. Most people think it\u2019s just a fast rock \u2018n\u2019 roll song. I didn\u2019t realise it at the time; I just wrote the song because I was commissioned to write it for the movie. But later, I knew I really was crying out for help."

                "Lost in the rise to fame, the author is pleading with the object of his affection to center him on a spiritual level.  Lennon\u2019s commitment to spiritual health is no secret to his fans,  a particular lyric found in \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d being a prime example of his devotion.\n\nSome believe this lyric is an instance of backmasking.  After it was rumored that Paul McCartney had passed away, fans began searching through the band\u2019s catalog for clues regarding Paul\u2019s death.  This lyric was one fans came across in their search.  Although it has nothing to do with anyone\u2019s death, it\u2019s interesting nonetheless.\n\nBACKMASKED LYRIC:\n\nNow he uses marijuana"

                "Having entered a state of depression and disillusionment following such a rapid rise to fame, Lennon felt like he needed to be brought back down to Earth. Pete Shotton, Lennon\u2019s childhood friend, claimed that these lines were written about him. Initially, Lennon\u2019s handwritten lyrics for this line read: \u201cI would appreciate you being \u2018round.\u201d The change to \u201cdo\u201d switches the meaning entirely\u2014it\u2019s now an expression of thanks rather than a request.\n\nThe frequent use of multi-syllabic words\u2014very unusual for pop music in 1965\u2014was the result of teasing by music journalist Maureen Cleave, who gently mocked Lennon\u2019s constant use of short words in his songwriting. Lennon responded by writing a song full of words like \u201cindependence,\u201d \u201cappreciate,\u201d and \u201cinsecure.\u201d\n\nThe closing lines to the chorus are also reminiscent of another Beatles number-one hit, \u201cPlease, Please Me\u201d\u201c\u2014even being sung in a similar falsetto:\n\nCome on (come on)\nCome on (come on)\nPlease please me (oh yeah) like I please you\u2026"

                "A Rolling Stone writer described this song as Lennon\u2019s first crack into the shell he\u2019d built to protect himself, finally letting his emotions out regarding his fears of their quick fame. \u201cHelp!\u201d was said to mark an important milestone in Lennon\u2019s writing style.\n\nDuring a Rolling Stone interview, Lennon said this was one of the few \u2018true\u2019 songs he\u2019d ever written:\n\nThey were the ones I really wrote from experience and not projecting myself into a situation and writing a nice story about it."
