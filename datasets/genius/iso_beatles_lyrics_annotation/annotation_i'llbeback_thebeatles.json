                "There is a slight bit of obsession in lyrics like these. Instead of looking at John as a stalker (Coincidentally his relationship with Yoko Ono began with her stalking him!), It\u2019s better to look at him as being determined like Diogenes who desired to learn from the Antisthenes. Antisthenes refused and even had to beat him off with stick, but Diogenes came right back and said:\n\nStrike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you\u2019ve something to say.\n\n\n\nHis determination softened the heart of Antisthenes who then took him to be his pupil."

                "It sounds as if John is trying to make himself a nuisance, like the cat that came back the very next day! John has always taken a much more jealous and possessive approach towards love than Paul McCartney:\n\nJohn was always on the run, running for his life. He was married; whereas none of my songs would have \u2018catch you with another man\u2019. It was never a concern of mine, at all, because I had a girlfriend and I would go with other girls; it was a perfectly open relationship so I wasn\u2019t as worried about that as John was."
