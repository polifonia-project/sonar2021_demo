                "A toned-down version of the need for reprisal in the first verse, but nonetheless still pusillanimous in the highest degree. John is steeped in hatred and he wants revenge and satisfaction\u2026 unfortunately he knows all he can do is cry it out\u2026 and maybe write a song about it."

                "It\u2019s strange, for how emotionally charged the lyrics are John Lennon didn\u2019t think too much of this song\n\nI wrote that for A Hard Day\u2019s Night, but Dick Lester didn\u2019t even want it. He resurrected Can\u2019t Buy Me Love for that sequence instead. I like the middle eight to that song, though \u2013 that\u2019s about all I can say about it.\n\nIt may be because it was cut from the movie and replaced with \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d\nIt\u2019s these types of songs which reveal the bands vulnerable side that allowed them to wiggle their way into the hearts of millions.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5p739_the-beatles-i-ll-cry-instead_music"

                "These lines show a lot of anger towards women. For as much love as John had inside of him, like any other human, he was also plagued by insecurities and memories of bad experiences. Other songs with misogyny and/or paranoia towards women include: \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That\u201d, \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d, \u201cGetting Better\u201d, and \u201cI\u2019ll Get You\u201d\n\nThese are rare instances though, and for the most part the band did nothing but praise the feminine spirit."
