A selfish song in a way because it doesn\u2019t consider how the abandoned girl might find her own sunshine, it was nonetheless an accurate reflection of Paul\u2019s romantic life.\n\nSee Steve Turner\u2019s book here"

                "McCartney wrote this song years before it found release. He recalled writing it in the front room of his childhood home at 20 Forthlin Road.\n\n\u201cI wrote that in my front parlour in Forthlin Road. I was about 16. I\u2019ll Follow The Sun was one of those very early ones. I seem to remember writing it just after I\u2019d had the flu and I had that cigarette \u2013 I smoked when I was 16 \u2013 the cigarette that\u2019s the \u2018cotton wool\u2019 one. You don\u2019t smoke while you\u2019re ill but after you get better you have a cigarette and it\u2019s terrible, it tastes like cotton wool, horrible. I remember standing in the parlour, with my guitar, looking out through the lace curtains of the window, and writing that one.\u201d"
