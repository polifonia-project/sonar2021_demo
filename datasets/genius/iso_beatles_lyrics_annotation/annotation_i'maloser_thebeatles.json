                "Back in 1960-1962, while John Lennon was married to Cynthia, he had an affair with a fantastic friend of the Beatles named Patricia Inder. Before a gig one day in Cavern club, John Lennon asked to marry Patricia. Later on, found out that his wife is having a baby (Julian). The baby news disrupted his plans with Patricia, so he had to let her go and care for the child. Patricia was distraught and angry at John until three years later; they meet again before a gig, and Patricia states that John saw her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the love of my life\u201d She meant so much to him, and he knew this love was one he should not have crossed."

                "\u201cI\u2019m a Loser\u201d was written in 1964 during John\u2019s \u201cFat Elvis\u201d period where he became heavily depressed. He explained this during a 1980 interview with Playboy:\n\nWhen \u2018Help!\u2019 came out, I was actually crying out for help. Most people think it\u2019s just a fast rock \u2018n\u2019 roll song. I didn\u2019t realise it at the time; I just wrote the song because I was commissioned to write it for the movie. But later, I knew I really was crying out for help. So it was my fat Elvis period.\n\nWhen asked about the song, John said:\n\nPart of me suspects that I\u2019m a loser and the other part of me thinks I\u2019m God Almighty."
