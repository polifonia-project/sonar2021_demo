                "Much the way \u201cA Little Help From My Friends\u201d was written for Ringo, this song was written specifically for George.\nMcCartney recalls:\n\nWe Wrote I\u2019m Happy Just To Dance With You for George in the film. It was a bit of a formula song. We knew that in E if you went to an A flat minor, you could always make a song with those chords; that change pretty much always excited you. This is one of these. Certainly \u201cDo You Want To Know A Secret\u201d was. This one anyway was a straight co-written song for George. We wouldn\u2019t have actually wanted to sing it because it was a bit\u2026 The ones that pandered to the fans in truth were our least favorite songs but they were good. They were good for the time. The nice thing about it was to actually pull a song off on a slim little premise like that. A simple little idea. It was songwriting practice."

The couple would rather dance than spend time holding each other. Perhaps this speaks to how the narrator wants a woman who can match his energy."
