                "These lyrics could be a subtle reference to Jane Asher\u2019s acting career; he could be speaking from the perspective of an audience, as he would know her best in a group of strangers. As Jane recites her lines, McCartney finds her words incomprehensible.\n\nThe whole song was about Jane, as Paul said:\n\nAs is one\u2019s wont in relationships, you will from time to time argue or not see eye to eye on things, and a couple of the songs around this period were that kind of thing.  This one I remember particularly as me being disillusioned over her commitment.\n- Via Beatles Ebooks\n\nShe was intent on furthering her acting career, but Paul assumed that she really just wanted to be away from him, as he continued:\n\nShe went down to the Bristol Old Vic quite a lot around this time.  Suffice it to say that this [song] was probably related to that romantic episode and I was seeing through her fa\u00e7ade.  And realizing that it wasn\u2019t quite all that it seemed.  I would write it out in a song and then I\u2019ve got rid of the emotion.  I don\u2019t hold grudges so that gets rid of that little bit of emotional baggage.  I remember specifically this one being about that, getting rid of some emotional baggage.  \u2018I\u2019m looking through you, and you\u2019re not there!\u2019"
