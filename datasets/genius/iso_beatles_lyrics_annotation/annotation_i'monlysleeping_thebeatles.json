                "The idea for the backwards solos came about after a tape operator accidentally threaded a tape into the machine the wrong way. Paul McCartney\u2014 confused about what that then-unique sound was\u2014asked if it was possible to do that for real, and so they tried. In December 2007\u2019s Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' records and the sixties, Paul described it as \u201ca beautiful solo\u201d and sounding like \u201csomething you couldn\u2019t play.\u201d\n\nGeorge Harrison, wanted the backwards solo to fit the dreamlike mood of the song, so he would later spend more than five hours recording takes with producer George Martin. Harrison first wrote down the notation for the solos he wanted, reversed them, and recorded them twice; one with fuzz effects and the other without."
