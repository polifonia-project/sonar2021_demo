                "The closing words of \u201cI\u2019m So Tired\u201d, muttered by John Lennon, became part of the \u201cPaul Is Dead\u201d myth in 1969. The myth alleged that Paul McCartney died in 1966. The Beatles are said to have covered up his death, despite inserting a series of clues into their songs and artwork. The story goes that at 5 am on Wednesday, 9 November 1966, McCartney stormed out of a session for the Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band album, got into his Austin Healey car, and subsequently crashed and died. Somewhat improbably, McCartney was said to have been replaced by a lookalike, called variously William Shears Campbell or William Sheppard. William Campbell allegedly became Billy Shears on Sgt. Pepper, while William Sheppard was supposedly the inspiration behind \u201cThe Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill\u201d.\n\nLennon says \u201cMonsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?\u201d It was, however, interpreted by some as \u201cPaul is dead, man, miss him, miss him, miss him\u201d when played backwards. Needless to say, this was not The Beatles' intention.\n\nI\u2019m So Tired is very much John\u2019s comment to the world, and it had that very special line, \u2018And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git.\u2019 That\u2019s a classic line and it\u2019s so John that there\u2019s no doubt that he wrote it. I think it\u2019s 100 percent John. Being tired was one of his themes; he wrote \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping\u201d. I think we were all pretty tired but he chose to write about it.\n-Paul McCartney"

                "\u201cI\u2019m So Tired\u201d was written by John Lennon three weeks into his stay in Rishikesh, India, where The Beatles had gone to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Free from drink and drugs for the first time in years, he found his thoughts abnormally focused, even if this meant suffering from temporary insomnia.\n\nThe song recounts Lennon\u2019s difficulty in sleeping after meditation had absorbed his thoughts throughout much of the day. It also recounts his burgeoning obsessions with Yoko Ono (\u201cMy mind is set on you\u201d) who remained in England while Lennon flew to India with his wife Cynthia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m So Tired\u201d was me, in India again. I couldn\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m meditating all day and couldn\u2019t sleep at night. The story is that. One of my favorite tracks. I just like the sound of it, and I sing it well.\n-John Lennon"
