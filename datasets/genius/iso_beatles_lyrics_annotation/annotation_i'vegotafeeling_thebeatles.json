                "This song was written in 1969 when LSD was at the height of its use. Very often when artists write about seeing the sunshine it is a reference to the use of LSD and other psychedelics. This could be Lennon referencing the widespread use of LSD as \u201ceverybody\u201d used it in the late 1960\u2019s and thus saw the sunshine.\n\n\u201cThe sunshine\u201d probably refers to Orange Sunshine, a popular/famous brand of LSD in California during 1968 and 1969."
