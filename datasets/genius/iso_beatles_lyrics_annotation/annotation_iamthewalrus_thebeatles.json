                "This phrase dates back to the Victorian prime of the British music hall tradition. It was used both literally, as a way to hold packages when you walked along, and as a slightly politer version of the American \u201cstick it up your ass\u201d.\n\n\u201cUmpa Umpa (Stick It Up Your Jumper)\u201d was first recorded by comedy duo The Two Leslies in 1935, but was made very famous by Jimmy Edwards' recording in 1950. The chorus has been a popular playground chant ever since.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7_jz8rTtcw"

                "These lines were recorded directly off a radio broadcast of King Lear. They are taken from Act 4, Scene 6. Lennon tuned his radio to the BBC Third Program on its final day before becoming Radio 3 and captured these lines quite by chance. They hold no thematic significance but add to the song\u2019s trippy atmosphere.\n\nThe opening line is spoken by John Bryning, playing Oswald. The conversation following his death is between Edgar, played by Philip Guard, and Gloucester, played by Mark Dignam."

There\u2019s a small sound that appears to be the first indication of the play before the 5th verse but it\u2019s almost undistinguishable, and the production will be picked up again by the end of the song. During this chorus, we get a portion of Act 4, scene 6:\n\n\nGLOUCESTER\nNow, good sir, what are you?\n\nEDGAR\nA most poor man, made tame to fortune\u2019s blows;\nWho, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\nAm pregnant to good pity."

People draw so many conclusions, and it\u2019s ridiculous\u2026\u2018I am the Eggman?\u2019 It could have been the pudding basin for all I care.\n- John Lennon\n\nAccording to the most commonly told version of the story, Burdon achieved \u201cEggman\u201d status through his habit of \u201cbreaking raw eggs on girls during sex\u201d \u2014 but as Burdon himself explained in his 2002 memoir Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood, it was actually the other way around.\n\n\u201cIt may have been one of my more dubious distinctions, but I was the Eggman \u2014 or, as some of my pals called me, \u2018Eggs,\u2018\u201d writes Burdon. It all started one sunny morning when he stood in the kitchen, \u201ccooking breakfast naked except for my socks,\u201d and a \u201cJamaican girlfriend called Sylvia\u201d took it upon herself to send the meal in an entirely different direction.\n\n\u201cShe slid up beside me and slipped an amyl nitrate capsule under my nose. As the fumes set my brain alight and I slid to the kitchen floor, she reached to the counter and grabbed an egg, which she cracked into the pit of my belly,\u201d continues Burdon. Long story short, the nickname stuck, and Lennon was thoroughly amused.\n\n\u201cI shared the story with John at a party at a Mayfair flat one night with a handful of blondes and a little Asian girl,\u201d Burdon recalls in his book. \u201c\u2018Go on, go get it, Eggman,\u2019 Lennon laughed over the little round glasses perched on the end of his hook-like nose as we tried the all-too-willing girls on for size.\u201d"
