                "This ode to a flowering relationship is out of fear of being hurt. Lennon is afraid to give himself to this new love because he doesn\u2019t want to be hurt like he has before. The pain of love and heartbreak is the strongest pain of all. Also, he doesn\u2019t want to view their relationship in a bad light. He wants confirmation from the girl; he wants her to say that she too, wants a beautiful, mature, dependable relationship. A true love. Not just a whim."

                "This was the first ballad Lennon ever wrote, even though it was a collaborative piece:\n\nThat\u2019s my first attempt to write a ballad proper. That was the precursor to In My Life. It has the same chord sequence as In My Life: D and B minor and E minor, those kinds of things. And it\u2019s semi-autobiographical, but not consciously. It shows that I wrote sentimental love ballads, silly love songs, way back when.\n\nSilly love songs indeed! But we love them!!"

                "This is a type of ballad that was only prevalent in John\u2019s early career. As Paul reminisced:\n\nPeople tend to forget that John wrote some pretty nice ballads. People tend to think of him as an acerbic wit and aggressive and abrasive, but he did have a very warm side to him really which he didn\u2019t like to show too much in case he got rejected. We wrote If I Fell together but with the emphasis on John because he sang it. It was a nice harmony number, very much a ballad.\n\nIn a much similar fashion to \u201cHard Day\u2019s Night,\u201d\u201c the lyrics for this song were written on a Valentine\u2019s day card."

                "McCartney was particularly proud of his contribution to this song:\n\nI was a big fan of the preamble in my early days, which you find in lots of \u201950s songs. A first verse that goes: \u2018I was living in Kentucky when I did, did, did and I dud-dud-dud, and then I said\u2026\u2019 [breathes in deeply]\u2026 then you break into the bit of the song you want everyone to know. One song I wrote a little after Please Please Me was my best attempt at a preamble: If I Fell. [Sings] \u2018If I fell in love with you, would you promise to be truuue\u2026\u2019 Then after the line, \u2018just holding hands\u2019, the song properly gets going. [Raises voice] That\u2019s it, everyone!\n\nThe band was always trying to do something more, incorporate something new into everything they did. Their ability to incorporate scores of musical techniques and innovative sounds is what eventually allowed them to capture the hearts of the entire world."
