                "While John is acknowledging the impact that these past memories have had on his life, he decides not to dwell on them and not to adopt the mind set of \u201cthings were so much better back then\u201d but instead try to think about how good his life is today, not how good it was a long time ago. Looking for the good in today instead of only seeing the bad in today and thinking about how much better it could be, if only it were the good old days. Love is always something new"

                "After the second verse, George Martin plays a piano solo. The reason it sounds so fast is because it is actually a clip sped up x2 from its original recording.\n\nThis speeding up of the piano is also what gives it its unique sound, sounding like a hybrid of a normal piano, and a harpsichord."

                "One of Lennon\u2019s most personal and heartfelt songs, it was written (much like McCartney\u2019s \u201cPaperback Writer\u201d) as a deliberate attempt to move away from the boy-girl love songs, such as \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That\u201d that dominated the Beatles' first five albums.\n\nI think \u201cIn My Life\u201d was the first song that I wrote that was really, consciously about my life, and it was sparked by a remark a journalist and writer in England made after In His Own Write came out. I think \u201cIn My Life\u201d was after In His Own Write\u2026 But he said to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you put some of the way you write in the book, as it were, in the songs? Or why don\u2019t you put something about your childhood into the songs?\u2019 Which came out later as \u201cPenny Lane\u201d from Paul \u2013 although it was actually me who lived in Penny Lane \u2013 and Strawberry Fields.\n- John Lennon, All We Are Saying by David Sheff"
