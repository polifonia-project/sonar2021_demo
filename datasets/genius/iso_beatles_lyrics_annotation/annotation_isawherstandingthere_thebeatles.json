Instead, the repetition of the title (i.e. the \u201chook\u201d) is what makes it so memorable, in a similar fashion to Fats Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame.\u201d\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of the progression for the verse is the utilization of the minor 4th (iv) chord (4th note of scale\u2013in this case an A, which becomes A minor, noted as a lowercase \u2018a\u2019).\n\nThe Beatles likely picked it up from doo-wop music, and used the technique quite often. The whole structure (melody + progression) also repeats for all remaining verses in the song.\n\nHere is a picture from McCartney\u2019s brother\u2019s book of Lennon & McCartney working on this very song:"

However, add to this the pure speed at which it is played and the fact that McCartney would simultaneously sing lead vocal and it becomes a rather more challenging piece to play.\n\nMcCartney openly admits that he actually stole this bassline almost wholesale from one of his heroes, Chuck Berry\u2019s 1961 single \u201cI\u2019m Talking About You\u201d.\n\nI played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly.

He felt it would make an impactful intro to the album.\n\nThe cue was actually part of the ninth attempt. When the band was getting frustrated that the record wasn\u2019t quite finished yet, Paul initiated the count-in as a way of pushing everyone to finish the take.\n\nThe only overdubs on this song are some handclaps recorded by the band immediately after the nine takes."

Ugh.\u2019 We were thinking of Butlins so we asked ourselves, what should it be? We came up with, \u2018You know what I mean.\u2019 Which was good, because you don\u2019t know what I mean.\n\nThe back and forth between Lennon\u2019s harder side and Paul\u2019s softer side can be seen with the line, \u201cthe way she looked was way beyond compare\u201d\u2014likely a line Paul wrote that matches up with his \u201ccute\u201d side.

                "The respective vocal styles of Lennon and McCartney are on full display in the hook.\n\nMcCartney traditionally wrote vocal lines that contained large, scalar leaps upwards, taking advantage of his impressive vocal register. Here, he follows the E scale up in fairly rudimentary intervals during his line, but then ascends a whole octave for the WHOOH!\n\nJohn, meanwhile, keeps things far lower on the spectrum. His line delivery is typically cynical and downbeat next to the showman McCartney, and his harmony takes several chromatic steps, staying narrow and turning it into an abrasive counter-melody."

                "The very first line in The Beatles' discography perfectly captures the Lennon-McCartney songwriting dynamic. McCartney had originally tried the opening line:\n\nWell, she was just seventeen\nNever been a beauty queen\n\nAfter wrangling his head for some time and deciding it just didn\u2019t sound right, he took it to John Lennon. Young Lennon was brash and more inclined to express his rock'n'roll swagger aggressively in his lyrics \u2013 this is one of the reasons why Paul became \u201cthe cute one\u201d and John was known as \u201cthe tough one\u201d during Beatlemania. \u201cBeauty queen\u201d reminded John of Butlins holiday destinations, which made the band cringe \u2013 after deliberation, John simply came up with \u201cyou know what I mean\u201d, and it stuck:\n\nWhich was good, because you don\u2019t know what I mean.\n- The Beatles Anthology (p.23)\n\nAt a glance, the line implies risqu\u00e9 sexuality, but as McCartney later said in 1968:\n\nPeople just take our music and a line: we say \u201cShe was just seventeen\u201d, and they read everything into that \u2013 \u201cshe was a seventeen year old nymphomaniac working on the streets of Broadway\u201d, but you know, what we meant is she was just seventeen.
