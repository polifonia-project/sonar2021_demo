                "This song is thought to be about how John Lennon felt about his then-wife, Cynthia, when it came out in 1965. The song reads like he is talking to Cynthia or maybe writing her a letter, reflecting on their relationship. According to the Beatles Bible website, the Lennons were also experimenting with LSD at this time, which makes this opening line all the more fitting.\n\nDrug use, however, later became a contributing factor to their divorce as well as his infidelity, according to Cynthia.\n\nYears later, in an actual letter sent to Cynthia, John stated their marriage was over long before psychedelics or Yoko Ono came along. The letter, written in 1976, went up for auction in 2017:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/78z4qOuz0t0"

                "In his book Revolution In The Head, Ian MacDonald explained how Lennon\u2019s melodies tended to be \u2018horizontal\u2019 in nature, often based around a single repeated note, whereas McCartney\u2019s would climb up and down the scales \u2018vertically\u2019.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Only Love, however, is more melodically \u2018vertical\u2019 than many of Lennon\u2019s compositions of the time. If Lennon was later ashamed by the lyrics, the winding tune and explorative chord sequence showed that he wasn\u2019t simply going through the motions of songwriting."

                "Even though Lennon wrote this song, he did not like the lyrics. Some of this lyrics describe his affection for Cynthia Lennon and how he felt about the situation he was living. Lennon knew how he loved her, and since all the fame was coming in his way he found it hard to love and spend time for her, but fame was being a huge problem blocking their love."
