                "Note the pun on \u201cbe long/belong\u201d\u2014according to MacDonald, this was a particular favourite of Lennon\u2019s.\n\nIn \u2018It won\u2019t be long till I belong to you\u2019 it was that same trip. We both liked to try and get a bit of double meaning in, so that was the high spot of writing that particular song. John mainly sang it so I expect that it was his original idea but we both sat down and wrote it together.\n\u2013Paul McCartney"
