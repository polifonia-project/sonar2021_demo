                "The inspiration for the title and repeating chorus may have been Larry Williams' 1958 song \u201cDizzy Miss Lizzy,\u201d which they covered a year later on the Help soundtrack:\n\nC'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby\nI want to be your loving man"

                "The chorus was John Lennon\u2019s idea. Ron King, who drove the Beatles' tour bus in 1963, recalled that he had scribbled it down and done nothing with it.\n\nThe rest of the song was written by Paul McCartney, with the idea that Ringo would sing it. Andrew Loog Oldham invited them to give the song to The Rolling Stones, who he was managing at the time. Lennon and McCartney combined their ideas, spent five minutes finishing the song, and performed a basic version. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards thought it would work as a Stones record, and happily accepted."
