                "The second verse suggests that the speaker doesn\u2019t care for the name of his love interest \u2013 he will love no matter what. And even though it\u2019s a pretty obvious description of devotion to a loved one, the verse also suggest that the speaker hasn\u2019t yet met the person he sings the song to.\n\nThis is further reinforced in the third verse, particularly in the line \u2018And when at last I find you\u2019, which is interesting, because the song is titled \u2018I Will\u2019. The speaker hasn\u2019t yet met the person, but he is already dedicating their life to them. This might refer to the feeling people in love get of knowing their love interests long before they actually meet them, just written from a perspective in the past."
