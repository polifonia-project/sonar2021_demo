                "Lennon was in India \u201copening up (to himself) regarding the feelings he had for his mother, Julia\u201d and for Yoko Ono. John often referred to Yoko as a \u201cmother\u201d and so he would have also opened up about the way he felt for her as well. John was inspired by poet, artist and writer Kahlil Gibran\u2019s quote and wrote these lyrics from it.\n\nJohn wrote \u201cWhen I cannot sing my heart, I can only speak my mind\u201d [based on] Gibran\u2019s quote \u201cWhen life does not find a singer to sing her heart she produces a philosopher to speak her mind\u201c"

                "This solo by John Lennon is about his mother, Julia Lennon, who was a big influence on John\u2019s life. This particular lyric could be describing his mother since she had long hair when he was young. In an interview with John he said the following:\n\n\u201cI lost her twice,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cOnce as a five-year-old when I was moved in with my auntie. And once again when she actually physically died.\u201d\n\nWhen John was a teen he had a better relationship with his mother and spent more time with her and his step siblings such as his sister, Julia Baird. In an interview  with her, she said the following:\n\n\u201cAs he grew older, John would stay with us more often [\u2026] John and Mummy would sit together and listen to records. [\u2026] John inherited his love of music from her [\u2026].\u201d\n\nDue to John only being a teen when he lost his mother, he would remember the good times and the positivity she gave him, so this lyric could be describing his mother."

He\u2019d been introduced to rock and roll by his late mother, Julia, and performing had initially been, amongst other things, a way of getting his mother\u2019s approval.\n\nThis line is a personalisation of a quote from Kahlil Gibran\u2019s \u201cSand and Foam\u201d (1926) in which the original verse reads, \u201cHalf of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you.\u201d"
