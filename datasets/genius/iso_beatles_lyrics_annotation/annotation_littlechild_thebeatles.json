                "This line was written, like the rest of the song, to be slyly suggestive.\n\nThe use of \u201cdance\u201d as a euphemism for sex is fairly well established \u2013 see Doctor Who\u2019s \u201cThe Doctor Dances\u201d for a prominent example:\n\nRose: What? Are you telling me you do\u2026 dance?\nThe Doctor: Nine hundred years old, me. I\u2019ve been around a bit. I think you can assume at some point I\u2019ve danced.\n\nContrast with I\u2019m Happy Just To Dance With You, where dancing is very definitely just dancing."
