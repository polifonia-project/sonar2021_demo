                "George is singing about God. George was a Hindu, so it is not the Judeo-Christian God, but George himself would often use \u201cGod\u201d instead of \u201cKrishna\u201d- see \u201cAll Those Years Ago\u201d as an example.\n\nGeorge refers to a lapse in his faith. He loved God, but still \u201clost\u201d contact with him.\n\nKanye West recounts a similar separation from God in \u201cJesus Walks\u201d.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think there\u2019s nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\nI wanna talk to God but I\u2019m afraid cause we ain\u2019t spoke in so long"
