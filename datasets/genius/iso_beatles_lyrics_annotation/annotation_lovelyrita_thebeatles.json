                "The absurdity of the song comes full circle with this line. People only think of parking enforcement officers when concerned about getting a ticket and fine for violating the rules. Here, the conventions of authority are reversed with the implication that the blissful protagonist\u2019s only concern is violating the parking officer."

                "This line contributes to the somewhat popular conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney died in a car accident and that he was replaced by a look-alike. Some theorists say that because he \u201ccaught a glimpse of Rita\u201d, Paul was distracted and crashed. There are many other very evident clues, but this song specifically details the supposed car crash."

                "McCartney\u2019s rhyme scheme here is seriously dense. \u201cRita\u201d and \u201cmeter\u201d are compound rhymes. Their first syllable rhymes with \u201cdiscrete\u201d; McCartney draws out the end of that word to emphasise the assonance. There\u2019s then a triple rhyme based on the assonance of the \u201cee\u201d sound.\n\nMove over, Rakim and Big Daddy Kane \u2013 Paul McCartney was spitting like Golden Age rappers in 1967."

                "In McCartney\u2019s native Britain, the primary villains of middle-class cities are more commonly called parking wardens. \u201cMeter maid\u201d is unheard of. When Paul heard the American phrase, it called to mind archetypal \u201csexy maids\u201d:\n\nThere was a story in the paper about \u2018Lovely Rita\u2019, the meter maid. She\u2019s just retired as a traffic warden. The phrase \u2018meter maid\u2019 was so American that it appealed, and to me a \u2018maid\u2019 was always a little sexy thing: \u2018Meter maid. Hey, come and check my meter, baby.\u2019\n\n\u2013Paul McCartney, Anthology"
