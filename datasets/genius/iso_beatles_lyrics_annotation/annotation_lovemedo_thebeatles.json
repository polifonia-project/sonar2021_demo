                "Originally sung by Lennon, the titular line of the song had to be given to McCartney, who takes the harmony on the verses, because of the need for Lennon to start playing his harmonica riff on \u201cdo\u201d.\n\nThe lyrics crossed over the harmonica solo so I suddenly got thrown the big open line, \u2018Love me do\u2019, where everything stopped. Until that session John had always done it; I didn\u2019t even know how to sing it. I\u2019d never done it before. George Martin just said, \u2018You take that line, John take the harmonica, you cross over, we\u2019ll do it live\u2019."
