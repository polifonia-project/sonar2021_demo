                "A turnstile is a form of gate that limits entry into a certain area and can be used in a range of applications from security to crowd control. Turnstiles evolved from the stile that was used for separating plots of land on farms and keeping animals in specific areas. The first use of turnstiles in a public place was at the Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow.\n\nIn the case of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, it is possible the turnstile could symbolize the end or continuation of the listeners journey with Lucy. Because a turnstile separates areas but still allows passage it leaves it up to the listener to determine the ending."
