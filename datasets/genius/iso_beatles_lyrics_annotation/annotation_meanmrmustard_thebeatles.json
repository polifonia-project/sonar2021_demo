                "Ten Bob Note = 10 shilling note. This is a note from before Britain decimalised its currency, and was equivalent to half an old pound.\n\nAlthough the image of a money up someone\u2019s nose is reminiscent of the common practice of snorting cocaine through a rolled up bill, John Lennon has stated in a 1980 interview that it had nothing at all to do with the drug. He said he read a newspaper story about a miser who concealed his cash not in his nose, but apparently in his anus in order to prevent people from forcing him to spend it. However, \u201casshole\u201d wouldn\u2019t be exactly fitting for a mainstream song in the late 1960s so it was changed."
