                "The name in the song was actually rumored to be biased off of Elvis Presley\u2019s sister in law. Elvis\u2019s wife Prissilla had a younger sister named Michelle. She had recently visited the Presley house for summer break, but only a week after returning home she was devastated to hear that the Beatles would be visiting right after she left. Prissilla requested that while The Beatles were over, they would sign several items so she could send them back to her sister. While the members were signing various things, they got caught up on her name, Michelle, and the spelling around it.  A few months later the song \u201cMichelle\u201d came out and Elvis insisted that the name came from his relation."

                "Ivan Vaughan, who introduced Lennon to McCartney in 1957, was still a friend to the group. Vaughan\u2019s wife Jan taught French, and when the pair visited McCartney at Jane Asher\u2019s family home in 1965, he asked for some help with the lyrics.\n\nI said, \u2018I like the name Michelle. Can you think of anything that rhymes with Michelle, in French?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Ma belle.\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s that mean?\u2019 \u2018My beauty.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s good, a love song, great.\u2019 We just started talking, and I said, \u2018Well, those words go together well, what\u2019s French for that? Go together well.\u2019 \u2018Sont les mots qui vont tr\u00e8s bien ensemble.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right, that would fit.\u2019 And she told me a bit how to pronounce it, so that was it. I got that off Jan, and years later I sent her a cheque around. I thought I better had because she\u2019s virtually a co-writer on that. From there I just pieced together the verses.\n- Paul McCartney"

                "The French element was inspired by parties held by Austin Mitchell \u2013 one of John Lennon\u2019s tutors at the Liverpool College of Art, and potentially the inspiration behind the song\u2019s title.\n\nHe used to throw some pretty good all-night parties. You could maybe pull girls there, which was the main aim of every second; you could get drinks, which was another aim; and you could generally put yourself about a bit. I remember sitting around there, and my recollection is of a black turtleneck sweater and sitting very enigmatically in the corner, playing this rather French tune. I used to pretend I could speak French, because everyone wanted to be like Sacha Distel\u2026\nYears later, John said, \u2019D'you remember that French thing you used to do at Mitchell\u2019s parties?\u2018 I said yes. He said, 'Well, that\u2019s a good tune. You should do something with that.\u2019 We were always looking for tunes, because we were making lots of albums by then and every album you did needed fourteen songs, and then there were singles in between, so you needed a lot of material.\n-Paul McCartney"

                "It is suggested by Ian Macdonald that this line is a knowing wink to the immature pop love song sensibilities they were keen to move on from.\n\nYou can clearly see how the Beatles changed by the time of the album Abbey Road.\n\nContrasting these lyrics to those of \u201cI Want You\u201d:\n\nI Want You\nSo bad\nIt\u2019s driving me mad\nIt\u2019s driving me mad.\n\nClearly, heaviness and angst had set in by 1969."
