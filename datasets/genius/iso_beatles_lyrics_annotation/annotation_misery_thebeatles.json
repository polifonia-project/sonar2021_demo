The progression ends with a classic G major to go back to C major (V to I) in the beginning of the next verse."

C major is normally reserved for pure and happy songs, but here it\u2019s being used for a breakup tune."

Lennon and McCartney harmonize as such:\nD-E-E (McCartney, higher part)\nB-C-C (Lennon, lower part)\n\nB and D implies the aforementioned G major chord (G, B, and D are the notes), while C and E implies the C major chord (C, E, and G).

There has also been recent evidence that whether men cry or don\u2019t, they are more emotional than women. With modern times has come the rise of sensitive men, for better or for worse, and the fall of macho men.

                "The Beatles' version of this song is completely, unremarkably typical of their early pop releases, particularly in the joint lead vocal style of Lennon and McCartney. McCartney only breaks from Lennon\u2019s lead melody for singular words in the chorus, which was likely his biggest contribution to the composition of this song.\n\nKenny Lynch actually attempted to co-write a song on the Helen Shapiro tour with Lennon-McCartney, but became frustrated with them at their inability to communicate with him and stormed off. The song this writing session would come to produce? From Me To You.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31Jwfv8WQMA"

Preferring to record the original song with the tapes running at double speed (30ips) allowed him to do this, and it was a practice used by The Beatles and Martin several times in their studio albums. Another notable use is in the piano solo of Lovely Rita."
