                "Society tries to downplay the importance of money. But it is also built in a way you need to pay for food and amenities, so everyone needs to get money to live! In the case of musicians, writing songs, performing them and getting paid for it (even if stupid fans cry \u201csell out\u201d). As Paul McCartney so eloquently put it:\n\nJohn would be getting an extension on his house or something, and the joke used to be, \u2018Okay! Today let\u2019s write a swimming pool.\u2019 It was great motivation. Then in the next three hours, \u2018Help!\u2019 appears from nowhere, you\u2019d suddenly get the idea, this\u2019ll be a hit, this is a good one. You become aware what you were doing was making money. Making good money."
