                "Paul McCartney (the primary writer of this song) grew up in the country near Liverpool, where he later moved and met John Lennon on July 6th, 1957.  The rest is history.\n\nHowever, during an interview in 1968, Paul had this to say regarding \u201cMother Nature\u2019s Son:\u201d\n\nIt says \u2018\u201cBorn a poor young country boy,\u201d and I was born in Woolton hospital actually \u2014 so it\u2019s a dirty lie."
