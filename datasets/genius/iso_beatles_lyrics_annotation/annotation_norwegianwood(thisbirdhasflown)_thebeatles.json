                "Lennon started composing the song on his acoustic guitar in January 1965, while on holiday with his wife, Cynthia, in the Swiss Alps. Lennon later explained that the lyric was about an affair he had been having.\n\nThe opening couplet flips the typical rock bravado of the time \u2013 showing a worldly urban woman, with her own place, own career, and who invites men to her abode to drink wine. She is markedly different from the love interests in early Beatles songs.\n\nAt the time, it was popular for swinging London girls to decorate their homes with Norwegian pine \u2013 so John is pleased with Norwegian wood since it indicates strong prospects for sex.\n\n\n\nThe key line here is \u201cOr should I say, she once had me\u201d. This is a very bitter song about assumed possession \u2013 \u201cI once had a girl\u201d \u2013 turning into perceived betrayal, through a failure to honour an unspoken bargain. Exactly what sort of bargain, becomes clear from the subsequent lyrics."
