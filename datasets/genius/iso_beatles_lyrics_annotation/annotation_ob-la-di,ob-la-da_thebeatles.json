                "Paul McCartney met his soon to be wife Linda Eastman  in 1967. The lyrics are glimpse into McCartney\u2019s future dream plans of being a husband and a father in the song \u201cOb-La-Di Ob-La-Da\u201d. The lyrics relate to being a husband in the 1960s ; men coming home from work to their wives and happy children. Following the release of the song in 1968, McCartney married Linda Eastman in March 1969 and had his child, Mary McCartney, on August 28th, 1969. The lyrics \u201cHappy ever after in the marketplace Molly lets the children lend a hand (foot)\u201d revealed that McCartney anticipated a long marriage and children."

                "After getting married, Desmond and Molly got kids, as they grew older they began helping Desmond in his market place that was mentioned in the beginning of the song. Meanwhile, Molly stays at home and stays pretty and in the evening, when Desmond and the kids are back, she sings it with them, \u201cthe band\u201d"

                "The song tells the story of Molly and Desmond, a marketstall holder and singer, who meet, fall in love and found a family. McCartney said:\n\nIt\u2019s a very me song, in as much as it\u2019s a fantasy about a couple of people who don\u2019t really exist, Desmond and Molly. I\u2019m keen on names too. Desmond is a very Caribbean name.\n\nTherefore, the name Desmond could be a tribute to Jamaican Reggae singer Desmond Dekker."

                "Yes, it says that Desmond, rather than Molly, stays at home and does \u201cher\u201d pretty face! Was this an ahead-of-its-time inclusion of a transgender character? Was Molly really accepting of her husband\u2019s proclivity for performing in drag?\n\nActually, the explanation is much more mundane: a simple error by McCartney. The line was supposed to be \u201cMolly stays at home and does her pretty face\u2026\u201d but McCartney liked the nonsensical nature of how the mistake came out and so decided to keep it.\n\nThe song \u201cGet Back\", on the other hand, does include a transgender character in the form of Loretta Martin."

                "McCartney \u201cborrowed\u201d this phrase from a Nigerian acquaintance of his, Jimmy Scott-Emuakpor, who would eventualy play with Bad Manners and allegedly also played bongos with The Beatles on an unreleased version of \u201cOb-La-Di Ob-La-Da\u201d. Jimmy later attempted to sue McCartney for stealing his catchphrase without permission, but the case was dropped when McCartney paid his legal fees for an unrelated issue.\n\n\u201cHe got annoyed when I did a song of it because he wanted a cut,\u201d Paul told Playboy in 1984. \u201cI said \u2018Come on, Jimmy. It\u2019s just an expression. If you\u2019d written the song, you could have had the cut.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is a widespread rumour that \u201cOb la di ob la da\u201d is a Yoruban phrase meaning \u201clife goes on\u201d, however, it is not proper Yoruba. Singer and artist Shinri, who claims to be Jimmy Scott\u2019s nephew and even wrote a song about McCartney and his uncle\u2019s debate says the family is Urhobo, not Yoruba, and in any case the expression is not in any standard language, because it is more of a family joke."
