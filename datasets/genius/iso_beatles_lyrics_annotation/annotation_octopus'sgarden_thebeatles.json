He felt as if he could relate to them in his current situation, which inspired the song.\n\nI stayed out on deck with [the captain] and we talked about octopuses. He told me that they hang out in their caves and they go around the seabed finding shiny stones and tin cans and bottles to put in front of their cave like a garden. I thought this was fabulous, because at the time I just wanted to be under the sea too. A couple of takes later with the guitar \u2013 and we had Octopus\u2019s Garden!\n\n\u2013Ringo Starr, Anthology"
