                "This could be perceived as being about John, because John was clearly slipping away from the band at this time.\n\n\n\nThis raw emotion had to come from somewhere, and likely it was not about Jane Asher, as Paul had been happily married to Linda for a month when the recording started. Also, does anyone feel like some of the lyrics are subtle references to John\u2019s song?\n\n\n\nFor instance, John begged Yoko, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down\u201d in a song for the earlier Get Back sessions (later titled Let It Be), while Paul promises:\n\nI\u2019ll never let you down.\"\n\nIn another (slightly more farfetched one), John said in \u201cHappiness Is A Warm Gun\u201d:\n\nWhen I hold you in my arms, I know nobody can do me no harm\n\nwhile Paul repeats:\n\nI\u2019ll never do you no harm.\n\nThis song was recorded from April to August 1969, which was building up to that day in September 1969 when John told Paul, \u201cI want a divorce\u201d and left the band.\n\nJohn was making it clear that he didn\u2019t need Paul anymore, and Paul was trying to get him back in to the spirit of the band, sensing what was going to happen and certain that the Beatles would never make it without John, which was true. Unfortunately, the rest is history and nothing could hold John in, especially not a vague song that John wanted to have a petty argument about vocals for instead."

                "Paul is anxious at the prospect that his partner is going to abandon him. To persuade her to stay, he vows that he\u2019ll never invoke any damage onto her, be it physically or mentally.\n\n\n\nThe Beatles performed this in their movie Let It Be. While rehearsing the song for the film, John announced that Yoko\u2019s divorce with her former husband had finally gone through and he improvised a verse about that."
