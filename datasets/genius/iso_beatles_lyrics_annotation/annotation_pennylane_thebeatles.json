                "This line is a humorous combination of two British terms. The wordplay is often lost on American audiences.\n\n\u201cA four of fish\u201d was a common order size for fish and chips, that is what you could get with four pence, while \u201cfinger pie\u201d was a Liverpudlian slang term equivalent to \u201cheavy petting\u201d.\n\nIn a 1967 excerpt from the Anthology McCartney said:\n\n[\u2026] we put in a joke or two: \u2018Four of fish and finger pie.\u2019 The women would never dare say that, except to themselves. Most people wouldn\u2019t hear it, but \u2018finger pie\u2019 is just a nice little joke for the Liverpool lads who like a bit of smut."
