                "This is probably a reference to a latin \u201cHomo homini lupus est\u201d, which is similar to the English expression, \u201cdog eat dog\u201d, meaning humans are enemies to each other and constantly in conflict with one another, with their only interest being self-preservation and satisfaction.\n\nThe \u201cbigger piggies\u201d don\u2019t care that they are eating their own kind, as they\u2019re too rich and high and mighty for it to affect them. This mirrors the real-life idea that those in the upper class can do such awful things while being completely oblivious to its potential effect on people.\n\nThis sort of thing happens in Animal Farm, where Napoleon and the other \u201csuperior\u201d pigs end up executing and sending to slaughter the other animals on the farm, despite agreeing at the beginning that they were one family who would all be respected equally."

                "This is both literal and metaphorical.  A clean ironed dress shirt is a symbol of higher paying work, but it\u2019s also contrasting the filth of the lowly pigs with the cleanliness of the wealthy pigs.\n\nLike in Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, the pigs were emulating human behaviors and wearing clothes to distinguish themselves from the other pigs.  This line is basically a way of saying that the pigs can cause all the dirt they want and just put on a new clean shirt whenever they want to."
