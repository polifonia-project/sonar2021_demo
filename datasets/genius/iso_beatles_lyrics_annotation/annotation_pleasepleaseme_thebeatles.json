                "George Martin\u2019s influence on this song is perhaps greater than at any point in The Beatles' career. His unwavering eye for a potential hit and willingness to tell his artists when their ideas were poor might not have always been what the band wanted to hear, but they grew willing to defer to his experience.\n\nPaul McCartney said of the sessions:\n\nHe said, \u2018Make it a bit faster. Let me try it.\u2019 And he did. We thought, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s all right, yes.\u2019 Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had."

                "The vocal style of this song, sung simultaneously by Lennon and McCartney, is taken wholesale from the Everly Brothers, particularly their 1960 hit Cathy\u2019s Clown.\n\nMcCartney holds a high E harmony through the entire line, whilst Lennon descends in the primary melody. McCartney said of the Everly\u2019s influence:\n\n\u201cI did the trick of remaining on the high note while the melody cascaded down from it\u201d."

                "John Lennon wrote the hook as an exercise in writing using a wordplay technique called polyptoton, which he first heard on a Bing Crosby record:\n\nI was also always intrigued by the words to a Bing Crosby song that went, \u2018Please lend a little ear to my pleas.\u2019 The double use of the word \u2018please.\u2019 So it was a combination of Roy Orbison and Bing Crosby.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSYsXi0ZoEk"

                "Originally, \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d was a slow, bluesy track written by John Lennon, who was influenced by Roy Orbison:\n\nI wrote it in the bedroom in my house at Menlove Avenue, which was my auntie\u2019s place. I remember the day and the pink coverlet on the bed and I heard Roy Orbison doing Only The Lonely or something. That\u2019s where that came from.\n\nWhen shown to producer George Martin, he didn\u2019t take to it, calling it \u201cdreary\u201d and saying that it \u201cneeded pepping up.\u201d He encouraged them to record Mitch Murray\u2019s \u201cHow Do You Do It?\u201d instead\u2014a 1962 demo version of this song appeared later, on their 1995 Anthology compilation. It would also be a #1 hit for fellow Merseybeat band Gerry and the Pacemakers.\n\nThe Beatles, however, were adamant that they should focus on their own material, and Martin worked with them to turn \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d into a more marketable single. This included the call-and-response backing vocals, showing direct influence from the doo-wop craze of the late fifties and early sixties."
