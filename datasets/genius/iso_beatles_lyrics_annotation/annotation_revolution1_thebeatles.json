                "1968 was a year of social unrest. On the day of the first recording sessions for this song, French president Charles De Gaulle dissolved the French assembly and called an election. This was in response to a month of sustained protest by young, left-wing radicals, as well as strikes and occupations at factories and universities. At the peak of the protest, nearly a quarter of the French workforce was on strike.\n\n\n\nThe year also saw 100,000 people march on the US embassy on London to protest against the Vietnam war. British students were also copying their French counterparts with sit-down protests at universities.\n\nThe atmosphere was not remotely the same as when the Beatles recorded All You Need Is Love the previous year. Symbolically, peaceful protests were dealt a hammer blow by the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jnr., the senior figure in the Civil Rights movement and a strong advocate of peaceful protest."

Hunter Davies credited the fall of the Soviet Union, in part, to the Beatles exposing the young Soviets to Western culture.\n\nThis has to be taken slowly, but the theory is young Russians preferred Lennon to Lenin, liked listening to Beatles lyrics and music rather than political dogma. Ergo, they refused to consider Western culture as decadent and Westerners as the enemy, and grew cynical about their own Communist propaganda.\n- Hunter Davies, The Beatles"

It\u2019s not that he embraced the world communist ideology, any more than democracy, but, he saw injustice throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this line, he\u2019s saying, that he\u2019s not alone at seeing the inequality of the sexes, the subjugation of the masses, the unfair distribution of wealth, and the suffering that millions endure. However, it\u2019s not an easy fix.\n\n\n\nThrow down one government, and the same government rises up, often with worse leadership, like it did in the Soviet Union.\n\nSo, he came to believe in \u201crevolution,\u201d as a term of art, in social consciousness, not bloody insurrection. Change begins within each person, with an awareness of the world around them, with empathy, and respect, for every living thing.\n\nHe was trying to get people to look inwards. This is what other great religious leaders have done, like Jesus and Buddha.\n\nI would categorize his revolution more in league with seeking a new religion, than overthrowing governments."

A later interview/discussion among the four that appeared in the IMG paper Red Mole (reprinted in Ali\u2019s memoir Streetfighting Years)\u2013gives a sense of the back-and-forth about the questions facing the struggle.\n\nJohn\u2019s song \u201cRevolution\u201d on the Beatles' White Album is a reflection of such discussions. It famously says that \u201cyou can count me out,\u201d but this is a comment on tactics\u2013specifically, the role of violence in the struggle."
