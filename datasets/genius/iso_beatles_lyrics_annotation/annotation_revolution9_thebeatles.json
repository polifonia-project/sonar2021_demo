                "\u201cRevolution I\u201d and \u201cRevolution 9\u201d originally started as one extended track that was split into two parts. In the combined track, known as \u201cRevolution I\u201d (take 20), Lennon can be heard repeating the word \u201calright,\u201d which eventually morphs into \u201cright.\u201d\n\nSerial killer Charles Manson thought that when the Beatles screamed the words \u201cRight!\u201d it was actually \u201cRise!\u201d meaning the black community rising over the white people. Manson saw the song as paralleling the message of the Bible\u2019s Revelation 9.  He saw the song as a prophecy of the upcoming black versus white revolution.\n\nThis song, as well as \u201cBlackbird,\u201d were seen by Prosecutor Bugliosi as being the inspiration for the printing in blood of the word \u201crise\u201d at the LaBianca home.\n\nManson in 1969:"
