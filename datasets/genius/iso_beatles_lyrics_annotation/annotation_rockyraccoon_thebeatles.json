In his book, A Hard Day\u2019s Write, Steve Turner quotes from Margo Bird of Apple Records:\n\nPaul had a moped which he came off one day in May 1966. He was a bit stoned at the time and cut his mouth and chipped his tooth. The doctor that came to treat him was stinking of gin and didn\u2019t make a very good job of the stitching which is why Paul had a nasty lump on his lip for a while."
