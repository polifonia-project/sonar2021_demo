                "These lyrics detail the consequences for breaking Lennon\u2019s fidelity rules: death.\n\nThe phrase \u201chead in the sand\u201d describes someone that chooses to dodge a particular situation by refusing to acknowledge it\u2019s existence. It alludes to the ostrich tactic of hiding their heads in the sand when danger arrives; this is not actually the case.\n\n\n\nBoth men and women who cannot cope with breakups fit this description as well; they deny that there ever was a relationship to speed up the process of moving on. Lennon could mean that this girl is better off forgetting him than anything else.\n\n\n\nIf Lennon is referring to murder, there are several notable cases where victims were found on the beach. One such case is the Australian mystery of the Somerton Man, where an unidentified man was found dead. His cause of death, identity, and killer still remain unknown. It is possible Lennon heard about this case and thought about it as he wrote this song; anyone who betrays John Lennon might have an unexplainable death."

                "The lyrics recall Lennon\u2019s previous excursions into misogyny, \u201cI\u2019ll Cry Instead\u201d and \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That\u201d, both from A Hard Day\u2019s Night.\n\nJohn was always on the run, running for his life. He was married; whereas none of my songs would have \u2018catch you with another man\u2019. It was never a concern of mine, at all, because I had a girlfriend and I would go with other girls; it was a perfectly open relationship so I wasn\u2019t as worried about that as John was. A bit of a macho song.\n- Paul McCartney"

                "The song, cryptic to begin with, provides this particularly disturbing lyric. Lennon is letting her know, she better take his word as gospel. If his girl thinks he is speaking hypothetically, she is mistaken. Quite the song from the same band who brought you, \u201cAll You Need is Love\u201d."

                "Lennon later expressed his dislike of the song, saying he \u201calways hated\u201d \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d. In 1973 he described it as his \u201cleast favourite Beatles song\u201d, although he did claim that it was one of George Harrison\u2019s favourites.\n\nJust a sort of throwaway song of mine that I never thought much of, but it was always a favourite of George\u2019s.\nIt has a line from an old Presley song: \u201cI\u2019d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man\u201d is a line from an old blues song that Presley did once.\n-John Lennon\n\nThe upbeat, easygoing groove of this song is completely at odds with its casually paranoid tone of impending retribution. The last line is chilling: \u201cOr you won\u2019t know where I am\u201d. The suggestion, plain as daylight, is that he\u2019ll be behind \u201clittle girl\u201d with a weapon in his hand, and she won\u2019t know what hit her. Hence the warning of the title: \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d. No wonder Lennon later disowned the song!"
