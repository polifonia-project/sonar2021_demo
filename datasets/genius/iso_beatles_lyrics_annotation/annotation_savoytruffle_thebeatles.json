He\u2019s got this real sweet tooth and he\u2019d just had his mouth worked on. His dentist said he was through with candy. So as a tribute I wrote, \u2018You\u2019ll have to have them all pulled out after the Savoy Truffle\u2019. The truffle was some kind of sweet, just like all the rest \u2013 cream tangerine, ginger sling \u2013 just candy, to tease Eric.\n- George Harrison, 1977"
