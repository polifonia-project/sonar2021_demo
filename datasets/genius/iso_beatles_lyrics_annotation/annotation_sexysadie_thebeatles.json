                "Sexy Sadie is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, as George Harrison explains:\n\nJohn had a song he had started to write which he was singing: \u2018Maharishi, what have you done?\u2019 and I said, \u2018You can\u2019t say that, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019 I came up with the title of Sexy Sadie and John changed \u2018Maharishi\u2019 to \u2018Sexy Sadie\u2019.\n\nThese lines seem to be modeled after Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' \u201cI\u2019ve Been Good To You\u201d, which begins:\n\nLook what you\u2019ve done\nYou made a fool of everyone\n\nThere\u2019s some irony in the fact that \u201cFool on the Hill\u201d, released about a year prior, was about Maharishi being perceived as a \u201cfool\u201d but actually being wise. Now Lennon is saying the \u201cfool\u201d made a \u201cfool of everyone\u201d."

                "Convicted serial killer Charles Manson is known to be obsessed with the Beatles, and particularly with the song Helter Skelter, also from this album. Susan Atkins, on of his \u201cfamily\u201d members was nicknamed Sexy Sadie.\n\n\n\nListening to the song after the fact makes this line especially ironic \u2013 even though the song is unrelated \u2013  as Atkins was incarcerated for life for participating in the Manson family murders."

                "This song is a subtle critique of the Maharishi. However, its title reflects a play on the double meaning of several terms. \u201cSexy Sadie\u201d is easily imagined as a woman who \u201cbreaks the rules\u201d and undresses \u201cfor all to see.\u201d\n\nIn the context of the Maharishi, those lyrics fit him as well. In 1970, John told Rolling Stone:\n\nThat\u2019s about the Maharishi, yes. I copped out and I wouldn\u2019t write \u2018Maharishi, what have you done? You made a fool of everyone.\u2019 But now it can be told, Fab Listeners."
