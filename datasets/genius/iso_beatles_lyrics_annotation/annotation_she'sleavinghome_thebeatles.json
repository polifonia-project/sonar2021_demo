But McCartney cleared that up in an interview:\n\nIt was just fiction, like the sea captain in Yellow Submarine; they weren\u2019t real people. The man from the motor trade was just a typical sleazy characer, the kind of guy that could pull a young bird by saying, \u2018Would you like a ride in my car, darlin\u2019?\u2019 Nice plush interior, that\u2019s how you pulled birds.

On February 27th, 1967 the London Daily Mail\u2019s headline read:\n\nA-level girl dumps car and vanishes.\"\n\nThe girl that ran away was 17-year-old Melanie Coe who describes a poignantly tragic tale in an interview with The Guardian. Her father was quoted as saying,\n\nI cannot imagine why she should run away, she has everything here.\"\n\nMcCartney said in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh,\n\nWe\u2019d seen that story and it was my inspiration. There was a lot of these at the time and that was enough to give us the storyline. So I started to get the lyrics: she slips out and leaves a note and the parents wake up, it was rather poignant. I like it as a song and when I showed it to John, he added the Greek chorus and long sustained notes. One of the nice things about the structure of the song is that it stays on those chords endlessly.\""
