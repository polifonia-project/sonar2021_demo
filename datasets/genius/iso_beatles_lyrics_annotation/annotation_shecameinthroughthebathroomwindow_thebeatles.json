Looking at the driver\u2019s identification panel, he noticed that it read \u2018Eugene Quits, New York Police Department.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I got \u2018So I quit the police department\u2019, which are part of the lyrics to that. This was the great thing about the randomness of it all. If I hadn\u2019t been in this guy\u2019s cab, or if it had been someone else driving, the song would have been different. Also I had a guitar there so I could solidify it into something straight away.\u201d \u2013 Paul, 1997"

But the only truth he had was a personal one, as the songs were ultimately personal for him, not universal."
