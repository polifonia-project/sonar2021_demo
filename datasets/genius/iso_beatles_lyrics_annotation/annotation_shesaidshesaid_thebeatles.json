                "Inspired by an acid trip, it recounts a bad trip for George Harrison. Actor Peter Fonda arrived, also tripping, and tried to comfort the frightened Harrison, who thought he was dying.\n\nI told him there was nothing to be afraid of and that all he needed to do was relax. I said that I knew what it was like to be dead because when I was 10 years old I\u2019d accidentally shot myself in the stomach and my heart stopped beating three times while I was on the operating table because I\u2019d lost so much blood.\nJohn was passing at the time and heard me saying \u2018I know what it\u2019s like to be dead\u2019. He looked at me and said, \u2018You\u2019re making me feel like I\u2019ve never been born. Who put all that shit in your head?\u2019\n-Peter Fonda"

                "This was originally planned to be a song of its own, but Lennon could not finish it, so George Harrison suggested he fit it into this one.\n\nHe had loads of bits, maybe three songs, that were unfinished, and I made suggestions and helped him to work them together so that they became one finished song, She Said She Said. The middle part of that record is a different song."

                "The lyrics stem from an LSD-fueled party with Peter Fonda that the Beatles attended in the 1960s. Fonda was remembering a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his youth that nearly killed him, knowing the feeling of death. Fonda quipped the famous line, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be dead.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Beatles took the memory to song, using the dark imagery to play out a relationship fight. Arguing, the two drive each other to feel like death is near, each pushing the buttons to make the other feel more sad than before."
