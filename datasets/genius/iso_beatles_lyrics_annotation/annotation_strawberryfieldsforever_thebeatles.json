                "This chorus marks a split between two different takes of the song spliced together by Beatles' producer, Sir George Henry Martin.\n\nEverything preceding this chorus, and at the beginning of this chorus, is from Take 7 of the recording session. However, starting with the lyric going to, the rest of the final studio version is from Take 26 of the recording session.\n\nWorth noting is that Take 26 is in a higher key and at a faster tempo. In order to make this work, Martin figured out he could slow down Take 26 to make it the same key as Take 7 in order to make the splice as seamless as possible.\n\nMartin recalled why Lennon wanted this splice to happen:\n\nEver the idealist, and completely without regard for practical problems, John said to me, \u201cI like them both. Why don\u2019t we join them together? You could start with Take 7 and move to Take [26] halfway through to get the grandstand finish.\u201d \u201cBrilliant!\u201d I replied. \u201cThere are only two things wrong with that: the takes are in completely different keys, a whole tone apart; and they have wildly different tempos. Other than that, there should be no problem!\u201d John smiled at my sarcasm with the tolerance of a grown-up placating a child. \u201cWell, George,\u201d he said laconically, \u201cI\u2019m sure you can fix it, can\u2019t you?\u201d whereupon he turned on his heel and walked away."

Spignesi note in 100 Best Beatles Songs: A Passionate Fan\u2019s Guide (2009):\n\nJohn\u2019s original opening line for the song was \u201cLet me take you back,\u201d not \u201cLet me take you down.\u201d (His acoustic demo of the song can be heard on Anthology 2.)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/50JhY-UIuwQ?t=1m6s\n\nThe original \u201clet me take you back\u201d most likely referred to his childhood, when he often visited the Salvation Army\u2019s children\u2019s home \u2018Strawberrry Field\u2019 for the summer garden parties with his aunt Mimi."

In The Beatles Lyrics (2014), Hunter Davies explains:\n\nThe phrase\u2026suggests not having any hang-ups, but also hanging from a tree possibly, remembering [John\u2019s] Aunt Mimi telling him not to climb over the wall and play there, and John replying, \u2018They can\u2019t hang you for it.\u2019"

The sentiment is associated with the Beatles' LSD phase, and has since been echoed in many other rock lyrics, including the first line of Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d: \u201cIs this the real life?
