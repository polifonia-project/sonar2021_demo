                "A hodge-podge of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese words, not really making particular sense.\n\n\u201cWhen we came to sing it, to make them different we started joking, saying \u2018cuando para mucho\u2019. We just made it up. Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, so we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got \u2018chicka ferdi\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a Liverpool expression; it doesn\u2019t mean anything, just like \u2018ha ha ha\u2019. One we missed: we could have had \u2018para noia\u2019, but we forgot all about it. We used to call ourselves Los Para Noias.\"\n- John Lennon\n\n\u201cQue canite\u201d is a play on \u201ccake and eat it\u201d, a phrase meaning that you want to have two good things which cannot exist together.\n\nIf you want to try and make sense of something that\u2019s not supposed to make sense, someone already \u201cdeciphered\u201d the verse."

                "The lavish and opulent court of the \u201cSun King\u201d, Louis XIV of France, was unprecedented in Europe.\n\nIt was a constant party, sort of like the Apple days, as chronicled , by Richard DiLello, in his book: \u201cThe Longest Cocktail Party\u201d."

                "Louis XIV, was called  \u201cThe Sun King,\u201d a title which originated with religious worship of the \u201csolar deities.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany civilizations believed the Sun was a god, and in addition to being our sustaining light, also took mortal form in kings, and supreme leaders. Even as late as the 18th Century, this belief endured, in tacit superstitious awe of kings.\n\n This validated the doctrine of \u201cDivine Right of Kings\u201d, which empowered a leader\u2019s supreme indomitable rule through legitimacy as deity.\n\nThe Beatles had affinity for Egyptian symbols, so, I\u2019ve always related this song as an homage to the Sun-God Ra, and Egyptian Sun-King, Horus the most enduring  messianic figure from the ancient Egyptian religion.\n\n\n\n.\nThis song, which is part of a beautiful medley on Side 2 of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d, has the similar lyrics to Harrison\u2019s Side 1 song, \u201cHere Comes The Sun\u201d, which heralds the sun returning after a depressing \u201cLong dark lonely winter\u201d\n\nWith only two English lyrics, other than this line,\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s laughing, everybody\u2019s happy\u201d\nIt seems as if they are also welcoming back the sun, as the \u201cSun King,\u201d to dispel a metaphoric \u201clong, dark lonely winter\u201d \u2026\n\n\n\nThis would fit with the messianic feel of those days in the late 60s, when the Beatles, individually, and together were experimenting and seeking enlightenment, borrowing from other cultures.\n\nThe concept of an \u201cAvatar\u201d or world savior, \u201cTHE Christ\u201d, as interpreted, was very prevalent in their Eastern religious journey.\n\nI used the Egyptian and Hindu religions, because, the Beatles were disconnected from Christianity, at the time this was written, but, from a Christian perspective and context, it is easy to assign this meaning to the \u201cSON KING,\u201d the \u201cSon\u201d of GOD, \u201cKing of KINGS,\u201d to return to usher in a new day.\n\n\n\nIn all great lyrical poetry, the ability to broaden the meaning to incorporate the reader/listener, is an unintentional, but, successful mark of genius."
