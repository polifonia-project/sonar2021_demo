                "Written from the perspective of the \u201cTaxman,\u201d this describes a 95% tax rate.  As Harrison stated:\n\nIn those days we paid nineteen shillings and sixpence out of every pound [there were twenty shillings in the pound].\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg article:\n\nThe top rate for British taxpayers in the mid-1960s reached 83 percent. The wealthiest among them paid a 15 percent super-tax on top of that, pushing taxes as high as 98 percent.\n\nAccording to their accountant Harold Pinsker \u201cthe first \u00a3100,000 earned was taxed at 87.5% and the second at 98%.\u201d\n\nThis high rate of taxation led to the Beatles setting up Apple Corp. By channelling their income through Apple, they could pay the much lower rate of corporation tax \u2013 instead of paying nineteen and sixpence in the pound, they paid only sixteen shillings.\n\nAnother big British band of that time, The Rolling Stones, even left the country in 1971 to flee from a 93% income tax before releasing Exile on Main St.. The high taxes in Great Britain were also the subject of The Kinks\u2018 \u201cSunny Afternoon\u201d."
