                "John claims to have written it very quickly for the concert sequence in the film:\n\nThey needed another upbeat song and I just knocked it off. It was like a black-New-York-girl-group song\n\nBut he later mentioned it was one of his favorite songs on the album:\n\nThere are four I really go for: \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d, \u201cIf I Fell\u201d, \u201cI Should Have Known Better \"\u2013 a song with harmonica we feature during the opening train sequence \u2013 and Tell Me Why, a shuffle number that comes at the end of the film.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zkHeij6Ha8"

                "This is a really upbeat song! Too bad it\u2019s about such negative subject matter. This song comes off with a very \u201cMo-Town\u201d, much like \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life\u201d\n\n\n\nEven through all of the sustained and upbeat energy, you can feel the destitution and anxiety that love can bring."
