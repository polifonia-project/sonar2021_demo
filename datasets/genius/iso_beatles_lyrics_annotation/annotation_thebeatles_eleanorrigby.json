                "Coincidentally or not, in the 1980s, a grave of a John Rigby was \u201cdiscovered\u201d in the graveyard of St Peter\u2019s Parish Church in Woolton, Liverpool. The inscription mentions Eleanor Rigby, apparently his sister.\n\n\n\nThe deeds to Eleanor Rigby\u2019s burial plot were for sale on a Beatles auction in 2017 but failed to reach the \u00a32000 reserve price.\n\nIt\u2019s well-documented that this exact church was the place when Paul McCartney and John Lennon met for the first time, when there was a gig in the church hall in 1957. McCartney confirmed the story in a 1991 TV interview.\n\n\n\n John Lennon performing at the St Peter\u2019s Parish Church Fete in Woolton, July 6 1957."

                "There\u2019s a lot to unpack here and no definitive answers. It could simply be that this is a surreal lyric designed to create an atmosphere of suspense and wonder.\n\nIt could be that Eleanor wears a lot of make-up, as this is sometimes called \u201cputting your face on\u201d and make-up comes in jars. Although nobody ever sees her, she still tries to make herself look nice in case anyone does notice her. Who is it for further develops the idea of loneliness, implying that she has no one to show her face to.\n\nAlternatively, \u201cwearing a face\u201d can be a metaphor for showing a veneer to the world; see \u201cMy Brave Face\u201d. Eleanor doesn\u2019t let anyone else see how lonely she really is, and sits smiling out of the window.\n\nThis could also go the other way. Eleanor doesn\u2019t have a veneer as she sits alone at home, but there\u2019s one waiting by the door in case she ever needs it. Alas, it\u2019s never used."

In 2014, he claimed she was an amalgamation of various lonely old women he\u2019d known in real life.\n\nIn particular, Paul was drawn to people who had experiences that he didn\u2019t:\n\nThere was a woman who lived near me in 20 Forthlin Road, where I used to go and get her shopping for her, just because I was on my way to the shops. I\u2019d just drop in, I knew her. So we became pretty good friends and she was a sort of lonely old lady. But I found out things like she had a little crystal radio set, which fascinated me, because people in the war made their own little radios, \u201cWhat! You can make a radio?! Brilliant!\u201d So she would be part of the \u2018Eleanor Rigby\u2019 thing.\n- Paul McCartney, in interview with Lily Cole for Impossible"

                "McCartney thought of this first verse before the rest of the song, and presented it to the other Beatles for their ideas.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald (Revolution In The Head), the spinster\u2019s name was originally \u201cMiss Daisy Hawkins\u201d. McCartney changed it after meeting Jane Asher in Bristol, where he saw a clothes shop with \u201cRigby\u201d in its name.

The closest Eleanor comes to getting married is tidying up on her own after everyone has left.\n\n\n\nWhile I was fiddling on a chord some words came out: \u2018Dazzie-de-da-zu picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been\u2026\u2019 This idea of someone picking up rice after a wedding took it in that poignant direction, into a \u2018lonely people\u2019 direction.\n- Paul McCartney"

These two lonely people do not meet and even if they did it would not have helped."

But it was too late, Eleanor died and they only \u201cmeet\u201d each other at Eleanor\u2019s funeral which Father McKenzie was officiating (and which no one came to). The line \u201cburied along with her name\u201d implies that Eleanor died with no one that will care for her and will be forgotten. No one was saved indeed.\n\nThis could also be implying how no one was saved because nobody came to hear Father McKenzie\u2019s sermon.\n\nBeing buried along with her name also means that Eleanor has no family (ergo the Rigbys end with her)."

                "Father McKenzie is one of the lonely people, forced to write church services that nobody will come to listen to. Either they come, but they don\u2019t pay attention to what he says, or they don\u2019t come at all.\n\nFather McKenzie is darning his socks, something one could reasonably expect a wife to do for him (priests in the Anglican Church can be married, and usually are); question is, no one else can see if his socks are darned or not, so why does he care? That he has to darn his own socks speaks to his isolation and lack of companionship.\n\nPaul McCartney spoke about this section in a November 2020 piece for Rolling Stone:\n\nFather McKenzie is \u2018darning his socks in the night.\u2019 You know, he\u2019s a religious man, so I could\u2019ve said, you know, \u2018preparing his Bible,\u2019 which would have been more obvious. But \u2018darning his socks\u2019 kind of says more about him. So you get into this lovely fantasy.\n\n\n\nThis character was originally named Father McCartney, but there was a concern people would think it referred to Paul\u2019s dad.\n\nI had Father McCartney as the priest just because I knew that was right for the syllables, but I knew I didn\u2019t want it even though John liked it so we opened the telephone book, went to McCartney and look what followed it, and shortly after, it was McKenzie. I thought, Oh, that\u2019s good.\n- Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now, Barry Miles\n\nThis line takes more significance in this time of declining church attendance."
