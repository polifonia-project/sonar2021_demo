        "[French Horn Solo: Alan Civil]",

                "Alan Civil was the principal horn player in the Philharmonia Orchestra and was paid a session fee of \u00a352.50 to play on \u201cFor No One.\u201d During the session, Paul McCartney pushed Civil to play a note that was beyond the usual range of the instrument.\n\nIn Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles, published in February 2007, recording engineer Geoff Emerick described the result of McCartney\u2019s encouragement as the \u201cperformance of [Civil\u2019s] life,\u201d and described him as \u201cthe best horn player in London.\u201d\n\nOn Mark Lewisohn\u2019s 1988 The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Alan Civil referenced the experience:\n\n[\u2026] they played the existing tape to me, which was complete, and I thought it had been recorded in rather bad musical style, in that it was \u2018in the cracks\u2019, neither B-flat nor B-major; this posed a certain difficulty in tuning my instrument. Paul said, \u2018We want something there. Can you play something that fits in?\u2019 It was rather difficult to actually understand exactly what they wanted so I made something up which was middle register, a baroque style solo. I played it several times, each take wiping out the previous attempt."

                "A composition from Paul written about Jane Asher, his girlfriend from 1963 to 1968, while on holiday in Switzerland in March 1966.\n\nI was in Switzerland on my first skiing holiday. I\u2019d done a bit of skiing in Help! and quite liked it, so I went back and ended up in a little bathroom in a Swiss chalet writing \u201cFor No One\u201d. I remember the descending bassline trick that it\u2019s based on, and I remember the character in the song \u2013 the girl putting on her make-up.\nOccasionally we\u2019d have an idea for some new kind of instrumentation, particularly for solos\u2026 On \u201cFor No One\u201d I was interested in the French horn, because it was an instrument I\u2019d always loved from when I was a kid. It\u2019s a beautiful sound, so I went to George Martin and said, \u2018How can we go about this?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, let me get the very finest.\u2019\n- Paul McCartney"

This idealization is then broken by reality\u2013breaking either the lover or the beloved (or both). Here, however, the artist is the one broken, sulking at home while his ex-beloved throws him aside."

This Pollyanna Effect in his mind keeps his interest in her and hope in their relationship alive past its expiration.\n\nEach verse, including this one, starts with a practical scene-setting observation, and then delivers the emotional punch. The singer is still shaking himself awake to the reality of the breakup."
