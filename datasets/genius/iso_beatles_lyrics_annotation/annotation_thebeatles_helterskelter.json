                "The song was recorded many times during sessions for The White Album. During one of those sessions, on 9 September, the band recorded 18 takes of approximately five minutes each, and the last one is featured on the original LP. After the 18th take, Ringo Starr flung his drum sticks across the studio and screamed, \u201cI got blisters on my fingers!\u201d\nHis shout was included on the stereo mix of the song.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0x978oZa3Y"

So I said to the guys, 'I think we should do a song like that; something really wild.\u2019 And I wrote Helter Skelter.\nYou can hear the voices cracking, and we played it so long and so often that by the end of it you can hear Ringo saying,\u2018I\u2019ve got blisters on my fingers\u2019. We just tried to get it louder: \u2018Can\u2019t we make the drums sound louder?\u2019 That was really all I wanted to do \u2013 to make a very loud, raunchy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record with The Beatles. And I think it\u2019s a pretty good one."

Thomas Nashe used it that way in his \u2018Four letters confuted\u2019, 1592:\n\nHelter skelter, feare no colours, course him, trounce him."

The original version of Helter Skelter lasted 27 minutes!\n\nPerhaps fortunately, this version has never been released, and is most likely still locked away in an Apple Studios cupboard somewhere."
