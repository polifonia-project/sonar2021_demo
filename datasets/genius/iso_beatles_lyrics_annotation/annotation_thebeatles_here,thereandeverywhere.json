                "A trained musical ear may notice that this bridge begins with a deceptive cadence: essentially, the dominant chord does not resolve to the tonic chord (in this case, D7), causing the bridge to bring an unexpected musical shift instead of the resolution that a listener expects.\n\nMcCartney\u2019s use of this chord progression actually aligns perfectly with the lyrics of the song. Observe that both the Intro and Verse 1 use the word \u201chere,\u201d while Verse 2 and Verse 3 both end on \u201cthere.\u201d Finally, on the bridge, McCartney finally sings that he wants and needs her \u201ceverywhere.\u201d\n\nTypically, a tonic chord (the D7) usually functions to bring the song back to its home key, but with the aforementioned chord progression, the bridge instead actually expands into a completely new direction.\n\nIn that lies a subtle part of the song\u2019s genius: both the song\u2019s lyrics and its chord progression literally go from \u201chere,\u201d to \u201cthere\u201d and then to \u201ceverywhere.\u201d"

                "Paul McCartney\u2019s favourite among his own compositions, it is regarded as one of his finest love songs. It was written in Weybridge, alongside John Lennon\u2019s swimming pool, while he waited for Lennon to wake up.\n\nI sat out by the pool on one of the sun chairs with my guitar and started strumming in E, and soon had a few chords, and I think by the time he\u2019d woken up, I had pretty much written the song, so we took it indoors and finished it up.\n-Paul McCartney\n\nWhile the song was written about Jane Asher, the vocal inspiration came from another beautiful lady who wasn\u2019t dating Sir Paul.\n\nWhen I sang it in the studio I remember thinking, I\u2019ll sing it like Marianne Faithfull; something no one would ever know\u2026 So that was a little voice, I used an almost falsetto voice and double-tracked it. My Marianne Faithfull impression.\n-Paul McCartney"
