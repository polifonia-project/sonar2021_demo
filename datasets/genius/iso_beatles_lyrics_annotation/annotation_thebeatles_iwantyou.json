                "These lines, and this song, were famously quoted in chapter four of David Foster Wallace\u2019s Infinite Jest, who was a fan of the Beatles' and their contributions to popular culture.  An interesting connection between the Baby Boomer Generation and Generation X, Infinite Jest is full of references like this.  \u201cWhy did DFW include this in Infinite Jest?\u201d, one might ask?  Like most of his references, and the plot of the book, there is often no specific reason or logic to his Beatles reference in this instance\u2026 it was simply something he was thinking of while he wrote the chapter, which makes the book very \u201cpo-mo\u201d, as he would say."

                "Considering the reference to \u201cgames\u201d earlier, this lyric could ironically mean the narrator will later force their conversation partner into arriving at the necessary conclusion themselves through games and trickery.\n\nIf interpreting this song romantically, however, the phrase \u201cI\u2019ll make you\u201d could mean the narrator wants to make love with the other person.   George seems patient and unvexed about this concept \u201cmaybe, next time around.\u201d"
