                "The original Leiber/Stroller composition as performed by the likes of Fats Domino and Wilfred Harrison includes lyrics like \u201cThey got some crazy little women there/And I\u2019m gonna get me one\u201d and \u201cIf I stay with that woman, I know I\u2019m going to die\u201d. This Beatles re-write however changes that completely: it is not about getting a new partner from Kansas City, but regaining an old love (early renditions talk negatively about the ex, rather than try to get her love."
