Once I\u2019d thought of that, it was easy. It all came out. No, I remember now, I\u2019d actually stopped trying to think of something. Nothing would come. I was cheesed off and went for a lie down, having given up. Then I thought of myself as Nowhere Man \u2013 sitting in his nowhere land.\n-John Lennon"

He told me later, he didn\u2019t tell me then, he said he\u2019d written it about himself, feeling like he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I think it was actually about the state of his marriage. It was in a period where he was a bit dissatisfied with what was going on; however, it led to a very good song. He treated it as a third-person song, but he was clever enough to say, \u2018Isn\u2019t he a bit like you and me?\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Me\u2019 being the final word.\n-Paul McCartney"
