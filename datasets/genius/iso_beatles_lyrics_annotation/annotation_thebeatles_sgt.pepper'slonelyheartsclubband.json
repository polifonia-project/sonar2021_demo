These two lines are seemingly inconsequential. But this stanza acts as a means of transition from the intro to the second track, \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends.\u201d"

                "This line further solidifies the circus atmosphere, as well as the album\u2019s literal introduction, by calling to mind the job of an announcer. In fact, based on the third-person wording of this stanza and the album\u2019s concept, these lines are probably intended to be delivered by some unidentified persona\u2014even though Paul McCartney is the one singing them.\n\nApparently, he had been influenced by the influx of more elaborate names in rock music during the late 1960s. According to John Lennon, during his 1980 Playboy interview captured in David Sheff\u2019s 2000 book, All We Are Saying:\n\nSgt Pepper is Paul, after a trip to America and the whole West Coast, long-named group thing was coming in. You know, when people were no longer The Beatles or The Crickets \u2013 they were suddenly Fred and His Incredible Shrinking Grateful Airplanes, right? So I think he got influenced by that and came up with this idea for The Beatles."

                "At the time of the recording of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s, The Beatles could be described as having entered a collective state of disillusionment. They had just decided to quit playing live (due to backlash following controversial remarks made by John Lennon) and they had just released their seventh and arguably their greatest album to date\u20141966\u2019s Revolver.\n\nBack in February of 1964, Newsweek Magazine said that the lyrics of The Beatles were \u201ca catastrophe,\u201d and that their music \u201calmost disastrous\u201d\u2013three years later, with the release of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s, this same magazine was comparing them to poets such as T.S. Eliot, Wordsworth, and Tennyson.\n\nThe dichotomy between such acute criticism and acclaim resulted in The Beatles\u2014and particularly Paul McCartney\u2014feeling that the best way for them to rise from the ashes would be to create music under new aliases and win over the world with charm, grace, and a little help from their friends."
