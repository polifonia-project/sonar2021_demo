The \u201cword\u201d referred to here is \u201cyes\u201d, and the big question crops up again in the closing lines: \u201cGive me your answer, fill in a form, Mine for evermore\u201d.

                "This song was written by McCartney when he was a teen and most likely revived due to the fact that his father turned 64 in the same year the recording was made.\n\nThe inspiration most likely came from Paul speculating about his own age, he wrote the song at 16 which is precisely \u00bc of 64.\n\n On May 17, 2006, Paul and his then wife, Heather Mills, separated, finalizing the divorce in 2008. McCartney turned 64 on June 18, 2006, so the answer to his musical question with regards to Mills, would be no."

He guided them and acted as a mentor carefully listening to their sessions and offering structured advice. Many even consider him to be like a 5th Beatle. He was knighted in 1996 for his lifetime of contribution to the arts."

We just stuck a few more words on it like \u2018grandchildren on your knee\u2019 and \u2018Vera, Chuck and Dave\u2019. It was just one of those ones that he\u2019d had, that we\u2019ve all got, really; half a song. And this was just one that was quite a hit with us.
