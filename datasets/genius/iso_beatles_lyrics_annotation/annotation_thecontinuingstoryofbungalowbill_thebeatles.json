                "In 1968 Richard Cooke the third an American Photographer for national geographic visiting India at the same time as the Beatles at the maharishi meditation camp went hunting for tigers. He rode on the back of an elephant because it was deemed to be the safest way to hunt dangerous animals at the time. Allegedly he was riding in the Rishikesh Indian bush and his elephant was startled by a tiger which Richard subsequently killed.\n Tiger hunting was then and is today the subject of great controversy. John Lennon expressed his mixed feeling about it in an interview where he pointed out the hypocrisy of a man killing a tiger in between meditation sessions\n\nPicture of the real life Richard Cooke"

                "In light of John Lennon\u2019s antipathy towards McCartney\u2019s Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, it may seem odd that he was responsible for this overly frivolous singalong that appeared on the White Album.\n\nThe song was written in Rishikesh, India. It was inspired by an American visitor who departed for a tiger-killing spree before returning to the ashram to seek spiritual enlightenment.\n\nThat was written about a guy in Maharishi\u2019s meditation camp who took a short break to go shoot a few poor tigers, and then came back to commune with God. There used to be a character called Jungle Jim and I combined him with Buffalo Bill. It\u2019s a sort of teenage social-comment song and a bit of a joke. Yoko\u2019s on that one, I believe, singing along.\n-John Lennon\n\nThe American in question was Richard Cooke III, known as Rik, whose mother Nancy was also on the meditation course in Rishikesh.\n\nThen a self-important, middle-aged American woman arrived, moving a mountain of luggage into the brand-new private bungalow next to Maharishi\u2019s along with her son, a bland young man named Bill. People fled this newcomer, and no one was sorry when she left the ashram after a short time to go tiger hunting, unaware that their presence had inspired a new Beatles song \u2013 Bungalow Bill.\n-Mia Farrow\n\nBoth Rik and Nancy went on the tiger shoot. Upon their return Rik told the Maharishi of his feelings of remorse, in a meeting at which Lennon and McCartney were both present.\n\nRik told me that he felt bad about it and said that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever kill an animal again. Maharishi said, \u2018You had the desire Rik and now you don\u2019t have the desire?\u2019 Then John asked, \u2018Don\u2019t you call that slightly life destructive?\u2019 I said, \u2018Well John, it was either the tiger or us. The tiger was right where we were\u2019. That came up in the lyric as \u2018If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him\u2019.\n-Nancy Cooke"

His macho, heroic act seemed to redeem the terrible crime to nature that he so effortlessly endured. It also goes back to the comic portrayal of his overbearing mother, attempting to justify the killing.\n\nThis is also the first time a woman or non-Beatle performed lead vocals in a Beatles track, in this case it being Yoko Ono, Lennon\u2019s muse and later wife."

Both she and her son maintained friendly relations with The Beatles for the duration of their stay, exception John Lennon, the sole author of this song, who by Cooke de Herrera\u2019s account was \u201ca genius\u201d but distant and contemptuous. Lennon is obviously making a jab at Cooke\u2019s masculinity by portraying him as dependent on his mother for emotional support."
