                "The repetition of this line can refer to the number of times they gave love to a person, but it could also be a gesture to the fans who have been on this journey with them.\n\nIt could also be a conscious nod towards the fact that The Beatles used the word \u201cLove\u201d more than 600 times in their career, and love and good vibes were part of many of their songs, particularly in their early years."

                "Careful listening at this point reveals the pitch of the song changes slightly, with McCartney\u2019s piano sounding slightly flat \u2013 possibly a side-effect of overdubbing the guitar solos.\n\nJohn Lennon wasn\u2019t generally happy with the work that was being done on Abbey Road and at one point wanted to have his songs on separate sides from Paul\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s Paul again, the unfinished song, right? We\u2019re on Abbey Road. Just a piece at the end. He had a line in it [sings] \u2018And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give [sic],\u2019 which is a very cosmic, philosophical line. Which again proves that if he wants to, he can think.\n-John Lennon"

                "This contains the only drum solo Ringo ever performed as a Beatle. He hates solos and had to be persuaded to do it. It\u2019s also of note that his drum track was spread in the stereo image, although it seems peculiar that the snare is panned to the far right.\n\nLennon, McCartney and Harrison took turns doing guitar solos. This is the only time in the Beatles' history that they did so. If you listen closely, you can hear how the styles change from one to the other. The order goes McCartney (stinging \u201cTaxman\u201d-style guitar), Harrison (slide guitar similar to his work on his 1970 solo album All Things Must Pass), Lennon (distorted heavy guitar like in \u201cRevolution\u201d) and then back again.\n\nIn the context of The End, this is the Beatles going out on top \u2013 proving themselves damn talented musicians as well as songwriters.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the times during the song each band member plays their solos:\n\n0:20-0:34  Ringo\n0:53-0:57  Paul\n0:57-1:02  George\n1:02-1:04  John\n1:05-1:09  Paul\n1:09-1:13  George\n1:13-1:17  John\n1:17-1:21  Paul\n1:21-1:24  George\n1:25-1:28  John"

                "Essentially, The Beatles' closing statement. It was intended as the last lyric on Abbey Road, the last album they recorded. Let It Be was the last album they released, but it was recorded earlier.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the end of the band and they knew it, though it wasn\u2019t spoken. The love they collected from everybody was the same intense love that they invested in the band\u2019s work. It\u2019s their last message of love.\n\nMusically, this last section goes from a sad and poignant A minor to a safe and happy C major, suggesting that despite troubles and hardship, everything will be alright in the end.\n\nAnd then \u2013 bam! \u201cHer Majesty\u201d makes a surprise, last minute appearance."
