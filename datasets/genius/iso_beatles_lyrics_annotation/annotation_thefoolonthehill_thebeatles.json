                "\u201cThe Fool On The Hill\u201d was Paul McCartney\u2019s major contribution to the Magical Mystery Tour album. In the companion TV film, it appeared over a sequence shot on a hilltop near Nice in France.\n\nNow that\u2019s Paul. Another good lyric. Shows he\u2019s capable of writing complete songs.\n\n\u2013John Lennon\n\n\n\nThe song was composed on the piano at McCartney\u2019s father\u2019s house in Liverpool, \u201chitting a D 6th chord.\u201d\n\nThe Fool On The Hill was mine and I think I was writing about someone like Maharishi. His detractors called him a fool. Because of his giggle he wasn\u2019t taken too seriously. It was this idea of a fool on the hill, a guru in a cave, I was attracted to.\n\n\u2013Paul McCartney"

                "McCartney:\n\nSaviours or gurus are generally spat upon, so I thought for my generation I\u2019d suggest that they weren\u2019t as stupid as they looked.\n\nThe \u201cfool\u201d sees the sun going down, but he figures out that the sun is not really going anywhere. He comes to understand (\u201cthe eyes in his head see\u201d) that the sun is still and the earth is turning.\n\nThis song is about the contemplative geniuses who see the world as it really is, and how others react to them."
