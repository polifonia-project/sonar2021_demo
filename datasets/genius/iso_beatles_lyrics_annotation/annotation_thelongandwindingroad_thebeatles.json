                "It is ironic that, owing to the melancholic tones in the song, the orchestral arrangement contributed towards the break-up of The Beatles.\n\nMcCartney and Spector disagreed over the composition of the song. McCartney preferred the traditional four-man recording and wanted to release the song like that, whilst Spector controversially overdubbed the final recording with an arrangement.\n\nFollowing the release of the song, McCartney legally pursued the breakup of The Beatles in April 1970."

                "\u2018The Long and Winding Road\u2019 is arranged with a repetitive opening theme. Additionally, the melody and subsequent lyrics do not validate whether the song is supposed to start in the opening stanza, as it is unclear where the bridge begins, and the lack of traditional chorus.\n\nLennon, unusually, plays bass guitar in this song and made several mistakes during the recording of this song. He plays it in a disenchanted, ragged style (which many commentators believe is purposeful).\n\n\n\nHarrison playing guitar, and Lennon playing bass during the music video in Let It Be (1970)"

                "McCartney\u2019s inspiration for \u2018The Long and Winding Road\u2019 emerged from the growing tensions in the Beatles. The lyrics in the song echo the unpleasant, grueling period of The White Album\u2019s development, McCartney\u2019s failed relationship with Jane Asher, the Let it Be sessions and Epstein\u2019s death, amongst other segments in The Beatles' history.\n\nOne way to interpret this is that McCartney expresses his belief that hardships are inevitable (truly prophetic, as the song was recorded in January 1969, eight months before Lennon announced his departure from The Beatles!)"
