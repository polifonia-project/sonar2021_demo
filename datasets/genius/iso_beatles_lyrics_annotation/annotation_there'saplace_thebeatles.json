                "The Beatles recorded this song on 11th February 1963 in ten takes. The tenth one was chosen as the finest, and John Lennon then overdubbed three takes of his one-bar harmonica solo onto it.\n\nThis song is notable for it\u2019s brevity and drive. Every section is incredibly short and leaves no room for breath before launching into the next one. George Harrison even joins in on vocals at the end of the verses to hammer the impact home. It would have been an impressive number to have seen live in their raw cavern club days."

                "This is one of the first occurrences of the famous Aeolian cadence in Lennon-McCartney\u2019s work. This is a musical term describing when the composer chooses to end a section with a minor sixth chord (in this case C#m) instead of the I chord (in this case E) that\u2019d sound natural to the human brain. This creates a dissonant tone that makes the song almost sound as if it\u2019s pining for the next chord.\n\nIt also appears most famously in the bridge of Lennon-McCartney\u2019s From Me To You.\n\nThe most crazy thing about all this is that Lennon-McCartney had no idea they were employing such expert music theory in their writing. It came completely naturally to them. Lennon hadn\u2019t even heard of the Aeolian cadence when it was brought up in an interview:\n\n\u201cI have no idea what aeolian cadences are. They sound like exotic birds.\u201d"

                "The most striking feature of There\u2019s A Place is the vocal melody. It is unconventional for a pop number of the time, featuring lengthy stretches where it drags an in-key melody over out-of-key chords. The reason the vocals and chords still don\u2019t clash is because the dissonant chords they choose (such as G# and F#) don\u2019t directly contradict the vocal melody.\n\nThis is a textbook Lennon melodic trope, and creates his inimitable abrasive singing tone. He drags a dissonant vocal melody through to the next chord on \u201cand there\u2019s no time\u2026\u201d and then chooses to mix up the chord he lands on. A similar technique is heard in Help!\u2019s verses."

                "Paul McCartney described There\u2019s A Place as one of their more mature early numbers.\n\nIn our case the place was in the mind, rather than round the back of the stairs for a kiss and a cuddle. This was the difference with what we were writing: we were getting a bit more cerebral.\n\nIt was composed by the pair at Paul\u2019s home, 20 Forthlin Road, as many of their early songs were."
