                "John eluded to the good and bad books he had read which described the word is love.\nThis is evident through reading the Bible, and the Bible even refers to Jesus as The Word. The Gospel According to John states:\n\nIn the beginning, the Word already existed; the Word was with God, and the Word was God. From the very beginning the Word was with God. Through him God made all things; not one thing in all creation was made without him. The Word was the source of life, and this life brought light to people.\n-1 John 1\n\nThe Word is Love \u2026 Is also found in the Bible.\n\nWhoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.\n- 1 John 4\n\nJesus, in the Holy Trinity, is God in the flesh."

                "The Word demonstrates The Beatles' increased awareness of their power as spokesmen and figureheads of the hippy generation.\n\nThe song was a collaboration between Lennon and McCartney, and began as an attempt to write a song based around a single note.\n\nWe smoked a bit of pot, then we wrote out a multicoloured lyric sheet, the first time we\u2019d ever done that. We normally didn\u2019t smoke when we were working. It got in the way of songwriting because it would just cloud your mind up \u2013 \u2018Oh, shit, what are we doing?\u2019 It\u2019s better to be straight. But we did this multicoloured thing.\n- Paul McCartney"

                "The lyrics displayed an almost religious fervour, with Lennon and McCartney acting as evangelists for their new revelation about love.\n\nThis was the first time they had written about love as a notional concept. It was a turning point in their writing, marking a transition between early songs such as \u201cShe Loves You,\u201d and the psychedelic era\u2019s belief that \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d\n\nIt sort of dawned on me that love was the answer, when I was younger, on the Rubber Soul album. My first expression of it was a song called The Word. The word is \u2018love\u2019, in the good and the bad books that I have read, whatever, wherever, the word is \u2018love\u2019. It seems like the underlying theme to the universe.\n- John Lennon"
