                "These lines exercise a special technique to create nostalgia about the present by projecting an idea of the future. Paul explains the technique here:\n\nIt was a slightly nostalgic thing already, a future nostalgia: we\u2019ll remember the things we said today, sometime in the future, so the song projects itself into the future and then is nostalgic about the moment we\u2019re living in now, which is quite a good trick. It has interesting chords.\n\nSome people think this song is riddled with such a nostalgic tone, because Paul was aware that the way they lived their lives would eventually drive them\napart."
