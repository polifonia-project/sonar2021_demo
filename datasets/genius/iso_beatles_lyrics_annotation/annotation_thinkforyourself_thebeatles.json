                "One of George Harrison\u2019s first philosophical songs, an unusually harshly-worded warning about the perils of leaving bad deeds unrectified. The inspiration behind the song is unknown. In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison claimed not to remember its origins, although he made a self-deprecating reference to the likes of \u201cTaxman\u201d and \u201cPiggies\u201d:\n\n\u201cThink for Yourself\u201d must be written about somebody from the sound of it \u2013 but all this time later I don\u2019t quite recall who inspired that tune. Probably the government.\n- George Harrison\n\nWhereas a number of Harrison\u2019s later songs were fileld with pseudo-cosmic wisdom, \u201cThink for Yourself\u201d is remarkable for its earthy sourness."
