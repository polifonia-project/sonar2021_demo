                "This coda, which is much faster than the rest of the song, was something Paul McCartney was particularly proud of:\n\nI think the interesting thing was a crazy ending: instead of ending like the previous verse, we changed the tempo. We picked up one of the lines, \u2018My baby don\u2019t care\u2019, but completely altered the melody. We almost invented the idea of a new bit of a song on the fade-out with this song; it was something specially written for the fade-out, which was very effective but it was quite cheeky and we did a fast ending.\n\n\u2013Paul McCartney in Many Years From Now by Barry Miles (November 1997)"

                "According to November 1999\u2019s A Hard Day\u2019s Write: The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song, by Steve Turner:\n\nThe girls who worked the streets in Hamburg had to have a clean bill of health and so the medical authorities would give them a card saying that they didn\u2019t have a dose of anything. I was with The Beatles when they went back to Hamburg in June 1966 and it was then that John told me that he had coined the phrase \u2018a ticket to ride\u2019 to describe these cards. He could have been joking \u2013 you always had to be careful with John like that \u2013 but I certainly remember him telling me that.\n\n\u2013Don Short (Daily Mirror music journalist)"
