                "According to the Beatles Bible, George Harrison had this to say about Lennon\u2019s lyrics:\n\n\nThen it says, \u2018Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void \u2013 it is shining. That you may see the meaning of within \u2013 it is being.\u2019 From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn\u2019t always active with thoughts. But you can turn off your mind, and go to the part which Maharishi described as: \u2018Where was your last thought before you thought it?\u2019\n\nThe whole point is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the physical world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and about the quality of the transcendent."

Rather than the British version, in which you just pop your clogs. With LSD, this theme was all the more interesting.\n- Paul McCartney"
