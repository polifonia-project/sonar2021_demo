                "Please Please Me, the very album where \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d is featured, was \u201crecorded, mixed, and edited\u201d in about 25 hours. That day John Lennon had an unfortunate cold. He sung lead on most of the album\u2019s songs, and was sucking on cough drops and gargling milk all day to soothe his throat.\n\nTwist and Shout was saved for last because of their knowing that it would put the most strain on John\u2019s voice.\n\nThat song nearly killed me. My voice wasn\u2019t the same for a long time after; every time I swallowed, it was like sandpaper.\n\n-John Lennon"
