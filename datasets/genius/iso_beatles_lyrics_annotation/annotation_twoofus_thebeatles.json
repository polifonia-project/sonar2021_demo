        "[Intro: John Lennon]\n I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids\n Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats",

            [
                "This is typical nonsense chatter from John Lennon, who had a twisted sense of humor. \u201cPygmy\u201d is a generic term for ethnic groups that have a short average height, although it classically refers to the Pygmy People of Western Congo.\n\nCharles Hawtrey was an old-hat comic actor in the \u201860s, \u201cdeaf aids\u201d is British English for hearing aids, and \u201cgetting one\u2019s oats\u201d means to have sex. Lennon is thus humorously introducing the song as if it were a movie by Charles Hawtrey and the unlikely \u201cDeaf Aids\u201d called I Dig a Pygmy.\n\nAlso, the May 1970 Let It Be film shows John saying this phrase. It appears to have been edited into the beginning of the song. All in all, it\u2019s just another joke from John Lennon."

                "Might be a nod to the cover of Help!, where both Lennon and McCartney are literally wearing raincoats in the sun.\n\n\n\nThe use of \u201craincoat\u201d instead of the British \u201cmac\"\u2014like in \u201cPenny Lane\u201d\u2014is probably aimed to fit with the American folk/western feel of the song."

                "This is another line that suggests the song is about Paul McCartney\u2019s relationship with John Lennon. \u201cChasing paper\u201d typically refers to earning money, although in this line they are trying to earn money and are \u201cgetting nowhere,\u201d which doesn\u2019t sound like The Beatles at all.\n\nAround the time of the Get Back sessions, the Beatles were embroiled in numerous lawsuits over their contracts. There\u2019s a reference to this in \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money,\u201d with a similar line, about bank statements and receipts:\n\nYou never give me your money\nYou only give me your funny paper"

                "These lyrics became strangely prophetic with the murder of John Lennon in 1980 \u2013 Paul met John in 1957, and \u201cTwo Of Us\u201d was recorded in 1969. 12 years had already passed for them, but they would only have 11 years for their future.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, \u2018longer than the road that stretches out ahead\u2019 is an odd lyrics if the song is about Eastman. McCartney met Linda only two years prior the recording of this song (1967).\n\nPaul had known Lennon for far longer and shared a precious relationship with him that encompassed teenage play, the start of The Quarrymen in 1957, and the start of the Beatles."

                "This is another lyric that seems to be referring to John Lennon, not Linda Eastman, as drinking and smoking together was an early Beatles pastime.\n\nIn Liverpudlian bars of the \u201850s and '60s, it was considered good etiquette to buy someone else\u2019s first drink. This was called \u201clifting the latch.\u201d After that, you could get other people to buy drinks for you.\n\nBy the time Paul and Linda met, neither would have been terribly concerned about getting their drinks cheaply."
