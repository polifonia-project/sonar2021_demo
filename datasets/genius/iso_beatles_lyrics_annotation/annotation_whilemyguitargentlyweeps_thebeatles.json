                "This song also represents a return from the sitar to the guitar. Since finding a sitar on the set of Help!, George had become enthralled in learning the instrument. He then realizes that all this time, he has left his growing process in the guitar for something he only thought was more mature/evolved.\n\nHarrison not only had Clapton play on the song because of their friendship but also for other reasons. He knew that the presence of Clapton would quit the fighting and bickering of the other members. Also, Harrison felt like it would not be right for himself to play the lead after his lack of recent commitment to the instrument."

After they leave he sees the mess after the show on the floor and he still is playing (weeping.)\n[Verse1B]\nHe doesn\u2019t know why nobody has taught us how to love and why we learn love through their music. Are people so easily controlled with words and idols? We are bought with their image and sold (tickets).\n\n\n\nAlso possible reference to the musicians who are bought and sold into the industry."

                "An early \u201cdemo\u201d version of this song (included on the Beatles' album \u201cAnthology Vol.3\u201d) had a different set of lyrics at this point:\n\nI look from the wings at the play you are staging,\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\nAs I\u2019m sitting here, doing nothing but ageing,\nStill, my guitar gently weeps\n\nThis set of lyrics brings focus to the meaning of the unexpectedly mundane \u201cI see it needs sweeping\u201d line in the 1st verse. George is chastising himself for being distracted by the mundane, standing backstage instead of \u201cacting\u201d to help change the attitudes of others.\n\nDespite replacing the majority of these lyrics with something more universal, it seems Harrison took this personal chastisement to heart, by devoting himself to aiding others. He took up many charitable causes, most famously \u201cthe Concert for Bangladesh\u201d in 1971."

The weeping guitar, as noted in other annotations, is played by his friend, Eric Clapton."
