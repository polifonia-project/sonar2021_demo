At dawn, Starr trudged up the stairs to head home \u2014 but the other Beatles cajoled him into doing his lead vocal then and there, standing around the microphone for moral support. Though nervous and exhausted, Starr delivered a magnificently soulful vocal, right up to that final high note."

Fans often threw jelly beans and jelly babies at them as they were performing."
