They understand the meaning of life when they die and by then it is far too late. As George Harrison wrote and composed this song he poured his beliefs of Hinduism/eastern religious teachings into the song."

This is only the 2nd Beatles song to do that, the first being McCartney in \u201cYesterday\u201d\n\nThe song features a group of unknown Indian musicians from \u201cThe Asian Music Circle\u201d in Finchley, North London.\n\nThis song was heavily influenced by Harrison\u2019s love of Classical Indian Music and Vedanta Philosophy.\n\nSome instruments featured in the song that are rather uncommon in western music are:\n\n\nSitar\nTambura\nDilruba\nSvarmandal\nTabla\n\n\n\nThis was Harrison\u2019s second full blown Indian recording, the first being \u201cLove You To\u201d"
