It was a very small part and I just went into the other room and put together \u2018sky of blue, sea of green.\u2019  They had always asked other people for help with a line or two, so I helped with that line.  He knew that I was into kids\u2019 songs and he knew I could help.  I\u2019m sure he could have written the line himself but I suppose he wanted someone to add a line and I added a line\u2026 It was nothing really, but he liked it and it stayed in."
