                "(Note: I use the word \u201cqu**r to refer to a group of identities, not as a slur. If you are upset by the use of that word, feel free to skip this annotation.)\n\nLennon speaks to other queer people, encouraging them to chant in sympathy with him.\n\n\u201cAll you clowns\u201d refers to a group of people. That group, judging from the song, is the LGBTQ+ community. The LGBTQ+ community (as alluded to in the chorus) is used to needing to \u201chide [their] love away.\u201d Lennon, like them, had to cover up his identity, and reaches out for support by calling them to sing with him (\u201cLet me hear you say\u201d). They have all had similar experiences, and at this point in the song, wallow in their shared despair. It\u2019s horrible, but at least none of them are alone."

                "The chorus of the song refers to homosexuality, or other LGBTQ+ sexualities.\n\nDuring the 60s (and still today, in some places) being LGBTQ+ was seen as disgusting, and sometimes a criminal offense. Because of the stigma that LGBTQ+ people faced, they kept their identities concealed in order to stay safe. Lennon includes this need for secrecy in the chorus; he and the person he\u2019s speaking to must \u201chide [their] love away.\u201d"
