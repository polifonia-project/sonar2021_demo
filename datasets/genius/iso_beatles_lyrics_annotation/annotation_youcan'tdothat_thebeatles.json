                "This wouldn\u2019t be the last time that John Lennon wrote a song about jealousy.\n\nThe following year saw the release of Rubber Soul, which featured Lennon\u2019s \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d \u2013 in which the threats of abuse to an unfaithful girlfriend gets even more dramatic.\n\nLater, on his 1971 solo release Imagine, the track \u201cJealous Guy\u201d featured the same sort of topic, although with much more self-conscious lyrics."

                "This line is quite representative of John\u2019s vulnerability in relationships. It begins with John gloating over his possession of this particular female, because of her everyone else is envious (green).\n\nHowever, he suspects she is playing him for a fool, and that others may also suspect the same thing, which in turn becomes a source of humiliation.\n\nThis song was heavily inspired by some of the R&B music John listened to:\n\nThat\u2019s me doing Wilson Pickett. You know, a cowbell going four in the bar, and the chord going chatoong!\n\nWilson must have acknowledged that he inspired the Beatles because he later on covered \u201cHey Jude\u201d"

                "This was actually the first guitar solo John Lennon plays on a Beatles album! He shreds too.\n\nI\u2019d find it a drag to play rhythm all the time, so I always work myself out something interesting to play. The best example I can think of is like I did on You Can\u2019t Do That. There really isn\u2019t a lead guitarist and a rhythm guitarist on that, because I feel the rhythm guitarist role sounds too thin for records. Anyway it drove me potty to play chunk-chunk rhythm all the time. I never play anything as lead guitarist that George couldn\u2019t do better. But I like playing lead sometimes, so I do it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krC2QWHzXz0\n\n(John Lennon guitar solo starts at 2:04)"

                "By this point, John is growing increasingly desperate. He is obviously very in love with this girl, and is no longer threatening but pleading her to stay with him and to stop her activities with other men. This time he try\u2019s to tell her he is not in control of his actions, rather he is driven by some kind of jealous neurosis, which is understandable considering some other songs like: \u201cI\u2019ll Cry Instead\u201d and \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d"
