                "\u201cYou Like Me Too Much\u201d was composed in 1965 by George Harrison, it is thought that it is about his relationship to Pattie Boyd who was a struggling young model at the time. The two met on set for the \u201cHard Day\u2019s Night\u201d in 1964, where Pattie played a small role in the film as a schoolgirl fan (She is the blond in the hyperlinked video) and was immediately attracted to him. George wrote many songs about her like \u201cIf I needed someone\u201d, \u201cSomething\u201d, \u201cFor You Blue\u201d and they got married in 1966 but she left George in 1974 for Eric Clapton."
