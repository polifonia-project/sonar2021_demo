                "A lorry is a British term that can be used to describe a large flatbed truck that carries goods, such as shipping containers and dry cargo containers.  In 1957, Lennon\u2019s band at the time, the Quarrymen, arrived at the St. Peter\u2019s Church in Woolton, Liverpool to play at the garden fete, on the back of a lorry. At times they would often play on the back of it as well. This was also the day when McCartney and Lennon met each other.\n\n\n\nBoth John and Paul were a part of the Quarrymen, and this was how the band often times got around."
