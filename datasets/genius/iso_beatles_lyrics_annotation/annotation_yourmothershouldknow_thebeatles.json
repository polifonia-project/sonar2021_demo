I always feel sorry for a parent or a child that doesn\u2019t understand each other.  A mother not being understood by her child is particularly sad because the mother went through pain to have that child, and so there is this incredible bond of motherly love, like an animal bond between them, but because we mess things up so readily they have one argument and hate each other for the rest of their lives.  So I was advocating peace between the generations.  In \u2018Your Mother Should Know,\u2019 I was basically trying to say your mother might know more than you think she does.  Give her credit."
