                "This line is a reference to the time Jane Asher refused to return Paul\u2019s calls after going to stay in Bristol.\n\nThe couple had had a pretty serious argument about Jane\u2019s insistance on becoming more independent, and she\u2019d left to pursue her acting career, something that Paul disapproved of. This quarrel eventually led to the couple briefly splitting up, although they did eventually get back together.\n\nAccording to author Howard Sounes in his biography Fab: An Intimate Life of Paul McCartney, Asher was almost twenty years old at the time of said argument, and was fed up of Paul\u2019s over-protective demeanour, protesting that she was being treated like a child.\n\nAs documented by authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies in his novel The Beatles, McCartney knew that he wasn\u2019t treating Jane like he should, and was devastated at the temporary break in his relationship, later saying:\n\nI knew I was selfish, it caused a few rows. Jane left me once and went off to Bristol to act. I said OK then, leave, I\u2019ll find someone else. It was shattering to be without her."

                "Following in the footsteps of great songs about phone calls, a frustrated Paul McCartney sets out to correct what he sees as immature behavior\u2014namely, his girlfriend Jane Asher\u2019s constant refusal to answer.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s worse here, however, is that the line is busy. The word \u201cengaged\u201d may have some Freudian implications, as he and Asher would later announce their engagement in December 1967. It didn\u2019t last long; Asher found Paul in bed with another woman and called the whole thing off.\n\nNote the use of four-note chromatic scale fragments, similarly used on August 1963\u2019s \u201cShe Loves You\u201d and December 1964\u2019s \u201cEight Days a Week.\u201d This technique helps to drive the song through its many moods, as Paul switches from \u2018frustrated\u2019 in this stanza, to \u2018hurt\u2019 in the next."

                "Written by Paul McCartney about his then-faltering relationship with Jane Asher, You Won\u2019t See Me was recorded during The Beatles' last session for the Rubber Soul album.\n\n\n\nIt was written at her parents' house in London\u2019s Wimpole Street, while Asher had temporarily moved away from McCartney to perform in an adaptation of Great Expectations at the Old Vic theatre in Bristol. The song recounts McCartney\u2019s frustration and vulnerability at being unable to contact her."

                "At 3:23, You Won\u2019t See Me was The Beatles' longest recording to date. The song was written by McCartney alone, and was inspired by the Tamla Motown sound.\n\nThis was written around two little notes, a very slim phrase, a two-note progression that I had very high on the first two strings of the guitar: the E and the B strings. I had it high up on the high E position, and I just let the note on the B string descend a semitone at a time, and kept the top note the same, and against that I was playing a descending chromatic scale. Then I wrote the tune for You Won\u2019t See Me against it\u2026\nTo me it was very Motown-flavoured. It\u2019s got a James Jamerson feel. He was the Motown bass player, he was fabulous, the guy who did all those great melodic bass lines. It was him, me and Brian Wilson who were doing melodic bass lines at that time, all from completely different angles, LA, Detroit and London, all picking up on what each other did.\n-Paul McCartney"

                "McCartney wrote the song the night after he got in an argument with Jane Asher and she walked out.\n\nIt\u2019s a song that marked a difference from the previous happier love songs. As Asher kept rejecting McCartney\u2019s calls and ignoring him for a while. During this year, McCartney\u2019s writing skills change drastically to mature and more personal content."
