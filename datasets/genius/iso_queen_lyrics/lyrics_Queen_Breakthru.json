 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhen love breaks up, (Breaks up)\nWhen the dawn light wakes up\nA new life is born\nSomehow I have to make\nThis final breakthrough, now!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI wake up, feel just fine\nYour face fills my mind\nI get religion quick\nBecause you're looking divine\nHoney, you're touching something\nYou're touching me\nI'm under your thumb, under your spell\nCan't you see?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nOh yeah\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Break through) These barriers of pain\n(Break through) Yeah, into the sunshine, from the rain\nMake my feelings known towards you\nTurn my heart inside and out\nFor you now\nSomehow I have to make this\nFinal (break)thru\n(Now!) Oh yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour smile\nSpeaks books to me\nI break up\nWith each and every one\nOf your looks at me\nHoney, you're starting something\nDeep inside of me\nHoney, you're sparking something\nThis fire in me\nI'm outta control, I want to rush\nHeadlong into this ecstasy\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough!\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nOh yeah\n\n[Instrumental break]\n(Breakthrough)\n(Breakthrough)\n(Break-)\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\n\n[Outro]\nBreakthrough!"
