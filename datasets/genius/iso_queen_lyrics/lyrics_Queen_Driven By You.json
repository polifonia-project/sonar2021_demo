 "lyrics": "[Dirt Gritie]\t\nWith hopes to be a video star, yes, this precious black harlot\nMore meat for the meat market\nThe matinees that she played\nAnd the bumps on this road that shorty would take\nShe worked in the morning, taught dance in the evening\nAuditioned for the videos on the weekend\nShorty was choice, light skin real cute\nDirectors often asked if she would pose in the nude\nWas it the art or the sex they would try to pursue?\nStood 5' 6, weighed 132\nShe had a fat ass and she knew how to move\nBut one wrong step could throw off her groove\nThere's some jobs you take and some you refuse\nThe difference between following and setting the rules\nBut your patients gone pay off soon stay on your lessons\nNext morning got a call for a Sean Paul audition\n\n[Spoken Word - Young Mav]\t\nDetermined she is\nFor every cent ever paid to an agency\nOr dance instructor\nFor every director or rap star\nWho inappropriately touched her\nFor the sleepless nights\nShe would sacrifice\nTo be more than a whore\nIn the video light\n\n[Dirt Gritie]\t\nLet's take about sex and how it sells\nHow shorty sold her self short for a bill\nIn South Africa shorty got'a fuck for a meal\nCause her landlords horny wants some thing to feel\nWho cares if she chills?\nThat's just another vacancy that'll fill he's still paying the bills\nIf one could escape from the physical realm\nAnd enter to a place where harmony dwells\nThen truly we would see that we're living in hell\nBig up your self young sister\nLife was on the right path but got caught up in a twister\nAnd now you travel through Oz\nWith the lights, cameras and move stars\nGlamour, gilts, whips, licks\nMen breaking you off with chips for dip\nThing is that you lost in the missed of this\nWhen did you become such a ruthless bitch?\n\n[Spoken Word - Young Mav]\t\nHow little attention we pay\nTo the rose that grew from concrete\nAs if we too would have come out unscathed\nHad her shoes been on our feet\nWe criticize her means\nTo get into the industry\nBut never cared\nWhen we seen her in the streets\n\n[Risse]\t\nWhat's going on?  What's the hold up?\nWhen's it gone be my turn I want a blow up?\nThe paper said 3:30 I'm here, I showed up\nMy bag got my gear, headshots, look these sluts\nAin't got nothing on me\nI was awarded Miss Edmonton in 93\nAnd graduated to be Miss Grand Prix\nOnly get manicures from the finest boutiques\nSee my hair, this is mine, I don't wear no weaves\nWhy I'm waiting in this line when I got a degree\nStill I'm young, got time to chase my dreams\nBut the more I run the further they seem\nTo invest my time in vanity things\nWhen they only looking for ass and tit rings\nMaybe I think I'll pass on this thing\nGo back to class and be queen\n\n[Spoken Word - Young Mav]\t\nAre you driven by self-esteem?\nOr selfish themes?\nThat promote hair weaves\nAnd lightning creams\nScared of enlightenment\nSo you lighten they're tint\nTo be the next video hoe\nThat your friends resent\nVanity is our demise\nSo late we realize\nWe'd all look the same\nIf we had no eyes"
