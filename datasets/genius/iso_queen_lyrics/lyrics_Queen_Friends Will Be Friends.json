 "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnother red letter day\nSo the pound has dropped\nAnd the children are created\nThe other half ran away\nTaking all the cash\nAnd leaving you with the lumber\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGot a pain in the chest\nDoctors on strike\nWhat you need is a rest\nIt's not easy, love\nBut you got friends you can trust\n\n[Chorus]\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're in need of love\nThey give you care and attention\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're through with life\nAnd all hope is lost\nHold out your hands\n'Cause friends will be friends\nRight till the end\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow it's a beautiful day\nThe postman delivered\nA letter from your lover\nOnly a phone call away\nYou try to track him down\nBut somebody stole his number\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAs a matter of fact\nYou're getting used to life\nWithout him in your way\nIt's so easy now\n'Cause you got friends you can trust\n\n[Chorus]\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're in need of love\nThey give you care and attention\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're through with life\nAnd all hope is lost\nHold out your hands\nCause friends will be friends\nRight 'til the end\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's so easy now\nCause you got friends you can trust\n\n[Chorus]\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're in need of love\nThey give you care and attention\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're through with life\nAnd all hope is lost\nHold out your hand\nCause friends will be friends\nRight 'til the end\n\n[Outro]\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're in need of love\nThey give you care and attention\nFriends will be friends\nWhen you're through with life\nAnd all hope is lost\nHold out your hand\nCause right 'til the end\nFriends will be friends, yeah"
