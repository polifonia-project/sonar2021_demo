 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere we stand or here we fall\nHistory won't care at all\nMake the bed, light the light, yeah\nLady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\n(You don't waste no time at all)\nDon't hear the bell but you answer the call\n(It comes to you as to us all)\nYeah, we're just waiting\nFor the hammer to fall, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, ev'ry night and ev'ry day\nA little piece of you is falling away\nBut lift your face, the Western Way\nBuild your muscles\nAs your body decays, yeah\n\n[Chorus 2]\n(Tow your line and play their game)\nYeah, let the anesthetic cover it all\n('Til one day they call your name)\nYou know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nRich or poor or famous\nFor your truth is all the same\nYeah baby (Oh no, oh no)\nOh, lock your door but rain is pouring\nThrough your window pane (Oh no)\nBaby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nFor he who grew up tall and proud\nIn the shadow of the mushroom cloud\nConvinced our voices can't be heard\nWe just wanna scream it louder\nAnd louder and louder\n\n[Chorus 3]\n(What the hell we fighting for?)\nOh, just surrender and it won't hurt at all\n(Just got time to say your prayers)\nEhh, while you're waiting\nFor the hammer to, hammer to fall\n\n[Outro]\nHey, it's...\nIt's gonna fall\nHammer, you know\nYeah, hammer to fall\nWoo! Yeah, yeah\nWoo, woo!\nHa, yeah, waiting\nFor the hammer to fall, now baby\nYeah, yeah\nWhile you're waiting\nFor the hammer to fall, ooh\nGive it to me one more time!"
