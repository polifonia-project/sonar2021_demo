 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven for everyone\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn these days of cool reflection\nYou come to me\nAnd everything seems alright\nIn these days of cold affections\nYou sit by me and everything's fine\n\n[Chorus]\nThis could be heaven for everyone\nThis world could be fed\nThis world could be fun\nThis could be heaven for everyone\nThis world could be free\nThis world could be one\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn this world of cool deception\nJust your smile can smooth my ride\nThese troubled days\nOf cruel rejection, hmm\nYou come to me\nSoothe my troubled mind\n[Chorus]\nYeah, this could be heaven for everyone\nThis world could be fed\nThis world could be fun\nThis should be love for everyone, yeah\nThis world should be free\nThis world could be one\nWe should bring love\nTo our daughters and sons\nLove, love, love, this could\nBe heaven for everyone\n\n[Bridge]\nYou know that\nThis could be heaven for everyone\nThis could be heaven for everyone\nThis could be heaven for everyone\n\n[Verse 3]\nListen, what people do to other souls\nThey take their lives, destroy their goals\nTheir basic pride and dignity\nIs stripped and torn and shown no pity\nWhen this should be heaven for everyone\n\n[Outro]\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven for everyone\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven for everyone\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven\nThis could be heaven for everyone4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
