 "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen the outside temperature rises\nAnd the meaning is oh, so clear\nOne thousand and one yellow daffodils\nBegin to dance in front of you, oh dear\nAre they trying to tell you something?\nYou're missing that one final screw\nYou're simply not in the pink, my dear\nTo be honest, you haven't got a clue\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm going slightly mad\nI'm going slightly mad\nIt finally happened, happened\nIt finally happened, oh-woah\nIt finally happened, I'm slightly mad\nOh dear, hahaha\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm one card short of a full deck\nI'm not quite the shilling\nOne wave short of a shipwreck\nI'm not at my usual top billing\nI'm coming down with a fever\nI'm really out to sea\nThis kettle is boiling over\nI think I'm a banana tree\nOh dear\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm going slightly mad\nI'm going slightly mad\nIt finally happened, happened\nFinally happened, uh huh\nFinally happened, I'm slightly mad\nOh dear\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\nOo-oo-ah-ah, oo-oh-ah-ah\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm knitting with only one needle\nUnravelling fast, it's true\nI'm driving only three wheels these days\nBut my dear, how about you?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm going slightly mad\nI'm going slightly mad\nIt finally happened\nIt finally happened, oh yes\nIt finally happened, I'm slightly mad\nJust very slightly mad\n\n[Outro]\nAnd there you have it"
