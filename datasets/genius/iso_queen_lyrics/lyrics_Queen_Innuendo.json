 "lyrics": "[Instrumental Intro]\nOne, two, three, four\nOoh, ooh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhile the sun hangs in the sky\nAnd the desert has sand\nWhile the waves crash in the sea\nAnd meet the land\nWhile there's a wind and the stars\nAnd the rainbow\nTill the mountains crumble into the plain\n\n[Chorus]\nOh yes, we'll keep on trying\nTread that fine line\nOh, we'll keep on trying, yeah\nJust passing our time\nOoh, ooh!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhile we live according to race\nColor or creed\nWhile we rule by blind madness\nAnd pure greed\nOur lives dictated by tradition\nSuperstition, false religion\nThrough the eons, and on and on\n\n[Chorus]\nOh yes, we'll keep on trying\nWe'll tread that fine line\nOh, we'll keep on trying\n'Till the end of time\n'Till the end of time!\n\n[Bridge]\nThrough the sorrow\nAll through our splendor\nDon't take offense at my innuendo\n\n[Spanish Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou can be anything you want to be\nJust turn yourself into anything\nYou think that you could ever be\nBe free with your tempo, be free, be free\nSurrender your ego, be free\nBe free to yourself\n\n[Instrumental Break]\nOoh, ooh, yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf there's a God or any kind\nOf justice under the sky\nIf there's a point, if there's a reason\nTo live or die\nIf there's an answer to the questions\nWe feel bound to ask\nShow yourself, destroy our fears\nRelease your mask\n\n[Chorus]\nOh yes, we'll keep on trying\nHey, tread that fine line\nYeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd whatever will be, will be\n\n[Outro]\n(We'll just keep on trying)\nWe'll just keep on trying\nTill the end of time\nTill the end of time\nTill the end of time!"
