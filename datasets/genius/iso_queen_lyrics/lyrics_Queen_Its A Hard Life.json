 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI don't want my freedom\nThere's no reason for living\nWith a broken heart\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis is a tricky situation\nI've only got myself to blame\nIt's just a simple fact of life\nIt can happen to anyone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou win, you lose\nIt's a chance you have to take with love\nOh yeah, I fell in love\nBut now you say it's over\nAnd I'm falling apart\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a hard life\nTo be true lovers together\nTo love and live forever\nIn each other's hearts\nIt's a long hard fight\nTo learn to care for each other\nTo trust in one another\nRight from the start\nWhen you're in love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI try and mend the broken pieces\nI try to fight back the tears\nThey say it's just a state of mind\nBut it happens to everyone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHow it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)\nWhen your love has cut\nYou down to size\nLife is tough, on your own\nNow I'm waiting for something\nTo fall from the skies\nI'm waiting for love\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, it's a hard life\nTrue lovers together\nTo love and live forever\nIn each other's hearts\nIt's a long hard fight\nTo learn to care for each other\nTo trust in one another\nRight from the start\nWhen you're in love\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\n(Yeah!) It's a hard life\nIn a world that's filled with sorrow\nThere are people searching\nFor love in every way\nIt's a long hard fight (hard fight!)\nBut I'll always live for tomorrow\nI'll look back on myself\nAnd say I did it for love\n\n[Outro]\nYes, I did it for love\nFor love\nOh, oh, oh I did it for love"
