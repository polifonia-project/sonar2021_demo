 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nHere I stand\nLook around, around\nAround, around, around\nBut you won't see me\nNow I'm here\nNow I'm there\nI'm just a, just a new man\nYes, you made me live again\n\n[Verse 1]\nA baby I was when you took my hand\nAnd the light of the night burned bright\nAnd the people all stared\nDidn't understand\nBut you knew my name on sight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhatever came of you and me\nAmerica's new bride to be\nOoh, don't worry, baby\nI'm safe and sound\n\n[Chorus]\nDown in the dungeon just Peaches and me\nDon't I love her so?\nYeah, she made me live again\nYeah\n[Verse 2]\nA thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky\nWhere the beams of your love-light chase\nDon't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain\nWith the rain running down my face\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour matches still light up the sky\nAnd many a tear lives on in my eye\n\n[Chorus]\nDown in the city just Hoople and me\nDon't I love him so?\nOoh, don't I love him so?\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nWhatever comes of you and me\nI'd love to leave my memory with you\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I'm here\nThink I'll stay around, around\nAround, around, around, around\nDown in the city just as you and me\nDon't I love you so\n[Outro]\nGo, go, go, little queenie!4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
