 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nHere we are, born to be kings\nWe're the princes of the universe\nHere we belong\nFighting to survive\nIn a world with the darkest powers, hey!\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd here we are\nWe're the princes of the universe\nHere we belong, fighting for survival\nWe've come to be\nThe rulers of your world\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI am immortal, I have inside me\nBlood of kings (yeah, yeah)\nI have no rival, no man can be my equal\nTake me to the future of your world\n\n[Chorus]\nBorn to be kings\nPrinces of the universe\nFighting and free\nGot your world in my hand\nI'm here for your love\nAnd I'll make my stand\nWe were born to be\nPrinces of the universe\n\n[Bridge]\nNo man could understand\nMy power is in my own hand\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nPeople talk about you\nPeople say you've had your day)\nI'm a man that will go far\nFind the moon and reach for the stars\nWith my sword and head held high\nGot to pass the test first time, yeah\nI know that people talk about me\nI hear it every day\nBut I can prove them wrong\n'Cause I'm right first time\n\n[Interlude]\nYeah, yeah, alright\nLet's go, let's go, ha-ha!\nYeah, watch this man fly, whoo!\nBring on the girls\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHere we are, here we are\nBorn to be kings\nWe're the princes of the universe\nHere we belong\n\n[Chorus]\nBorn to be kings\nPrinces of the universe\nFighting and free\nGot the world in my hands\nI'm here for your love\nAnd I'll make my stand\nWe were born to be\nPrinces of the universe\n(Universe, universe, universe)"
