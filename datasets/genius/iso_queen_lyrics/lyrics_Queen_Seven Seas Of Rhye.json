 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nFear me you Lords\nAnd lady preachers\nI descend upon your earth\nFrom the skies\nI command your very souls\nYou unbelievers\n\n[Chorus]\nBring before me what is mine\nThe seven seas of Rhye\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan you hear me you peers\nAnd privy counselors?\nI stand before you naked to the eyes\nI will destroy any man\nWho dares abuse my trust\n\n[Chorus]\nI swear that you'll be mine\nThe seven seas of Rhye\n\n[Bridge]\nSister, I live and lie for you\nMister, do and I'll die\nYou are mine, I possess you\nI belong to you forever (Ever, ever)\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nStorm the master-marathon\nI\u2019ll fly through\nBy flash and thunder-fire\nAnd I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)\nThen I'll defy the laws of nature (I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive)\nAnd come out alive, then I'll get you\nBe gone with you\nYou shod and shady senators\nGive out the good\nLeave out the bad evil cries\nI challenge the mighty Titan\nAnd his troubadours\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd with a smile\nI'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye\n\n[Outro]\nOh I do like to be beside the seaside!\nOh I do like to be beside by the sea\nI do like to stroll upon the Prom, Prom, Prom!\nWhere the brass band plays: \"tiddely-om-pom-pom!\"\nOh I do like to be beside the seaside!\nOh I do like to be beside by the sea\nWhen I'm down beside the sea, I'm beside meself with glee\nBeside the seaside! Beside the sea17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
