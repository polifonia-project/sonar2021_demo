 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEmpty spaces, what are we living for?\nAbandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on\nDoes anybody know what we are looking for?\nAnother hero, another mindless crime\nBehind the curtain, in the pantomime\nHold the line\nDoes anybody want to take it anymore?\n\n[Chorus]\nThe show must go on\nThe show must go on, yeah\nInside my heart is breaking\nMy makeup may be flaking\nBut my smile, still, stays on\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance\nAnother heartache, another failed romance, on and on\nDoes anybody know what we are living for?\nI guess I'm learning\nI must be warmer now\nI'll soon be turning, round the corner now\nOutside the dawn is breaking\nBut inside in the dark I'm aching to be free\n\n[Chorus]\nThe show must go on\nThe show must go on\nInside my heart is breaking\nMy makeup may be flaking\nBut my smile, still, stays on\n\n[Bridge]\nMy soul is painted like the wings of butterflies\nFairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die\nI can fly, my friends\n\n[Chorus]\nThe show must go on\nThe show must go on\nI'll face it with a grin\nI'm never giving in\nOn with the show\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll top the bill\nI'll overkill\nI have to find the will to carry on\nOn with the show\nShow must go on\nShow must go on"
