 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSometimes I get to feeling\nI was back in the old days, long ago\nWhen we were kids\nWhen we were young\nThings seemed so perfect, you know\nThe days were endless\nWe were crazy, we were young\nThe sun was always shining\nWe just lived for fun\nSometimes it seems like lately\nI just don't know\nThe rest of my life's been just a show\n\n[Chorus]\nThose were the days of our lives\nThe bad things in life were so few\nThose days are all gone\nNow but one thing is true\nWhen I look and I find I still love you\n[Verse 2]\nYou can't turn back the clock\nYou can't turn back the tide\nAin't that a shame?\nOoh, I'd like to go back one time\nOn a roller coaster ride\nWhen life was just a game\nNo use in sitting and thinking\nOn what you did\nWhen you can lay back\nAnd enjoy it through your kids\nSometimes it seems like lately\nI just don't know\nBetter sit back and go with the flow\n[Chorus]\n'Cause these are the days of our lives\nThey've flown in the swiftness of time\nThese days are all gone\nNow but some things remain\nWhen I look and I find no change\n[Guitar solo]\n[Chorus]\nThose were the days of our lives, yeah\nThe bad things in life were so few\nThose days are all gone\nNow but one thing's still true\nWhen I look and I find I still love you\n[Outro]\nI still love you8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
