 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm just the pieces\nOf the man I used to be\nToo many bitter tears\nAre raining down on me\nI'm far away from home\nAnd I've been facing this alone\nFor much too long\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I feel like no one\nEver told the truth to me\nAbout growing up\nAnd what a struggle it would be\nIn my tangled state of mind\nI've been looking back to find\nWhere I went wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nToo much love will kill you\nIf you can't make up your mind\nTorn between the lover\nAnd the love you leave behind\nYou're headed for disaster\n'Cause you never read the signs\nToo much love will kill you every time\n[Verse 3]\nI'm just the shadow\nOf the man I used to be\nAnd it seems like there's\nNo way out of this for me\nI used to bring you sunshine\nNow all I ever do is bring you down\n\n[Verse 4]\nOoh, how would it be\nIf you were standing in my shoes?\nCan't you see that\nIt's impossible to choose?\nNo, there's no making sense of it\nEvery way I go I'm bound to lose\nOh, yes!\n\n[Chorus]\nToo much love will kill you\nJust as sure as none at all\nIt'll drain the power that's in you\nMake you plead and scream and crawl\nAnd the pain will make you crazy\nYou're the victim of your crime\nToo much love will kill you every time\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, too much love will kill you\nIt'll make your life a lie\nYes, too much love will kill you\nAnd you won't understand why\nYou'd give your life\nYou'd sell your soul\nBut here it comes again\nToo much love will kill you\n\n[Outro]\nIn the end\nIn the end11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
