 "lyrics": "[Intro: Freddie Mercury]\nMmm num ba de\nDum bum ba be\nDoo buh dum ba beh beh\n\n[Verse 1: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]\nPressure pushing down on me\nPressing down on you, no man ask for\nUnder pressure that burns a building down\nSplits a family in two\nPuts people on streets\n\n[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]\nUm ba ba be\nUm ba ba be\nDe day da\nEe day da- that's okay\n\n[Chorus: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]\nIt's the terror of knowing what this world is about\nWatching some good friends screaming, \"Let me out!\"\nPray tomorrow gets me higher\nPressure on people, people on streets\n\n[Verse 2: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]\nDay day de mm hm\nDa da da ba ba\nOkay\nChipping around, kick my brains around the floor\nThese are the days it never rains but it pours\nEe do ba be\nEe da ba ba ba\nUm bo bo\nBe lap\nPeople on streets\nEe da de da de\nPeople on streets\nEe da de da de da de da\n\n[Chorus: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]\nIt's the terror of knowing what this world is about\nWatching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'\nPray tomorrow gets me higher, high\nPressure on people, people on streets\n\n[Bridge: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]\nTurned away from it all like a blind man\nSat on a fence but it don't work\nKeep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn\nWhy, why, why?\nLove, love, love, love, love\nInsanity laughs under pressure we're breaking\n\n[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]\nCan't we give ourselves one more chance?\nWhy can't we give love that one more chance?\nWhy can't we give love, give love, give love, give love\nGive love, give love, give love, give love, give love?\n\n[Outro: David Bowie]\nBecause love's such an old-fashioned word\nAnd love dares you to care for\nThe people on the (People on streets) edge of the night\nAnd love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of\nCaring about ourselves\nThis is our last dance\nThis is our last dance\nThis is ourselves under pressure\nUnder pressure\nUnder pressure\nPressure"
