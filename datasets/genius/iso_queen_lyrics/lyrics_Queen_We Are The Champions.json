 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've paid my dues\nTime after time\nI've done my sentence\nBut committed no crime\nAnd bad mistakes\nI've made a few\nI've had my share of sand kicked in my face\nBut I've come through\n(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)\n[Chorus]\nWe are the champions, my friends\nAnd we'll keep on fighting 'til the end\nWe are the champions\nWe are the champions\nNo time for losers\n'Cause we are the champions\nOf the world\n[Verse 2]\nI've taken my bows\nAnd my curtain calls\nYou brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it\nI thank you all\nBut it's been no bed of roses\nNo pleasure cruise\nI consider it a challenge before the whole human race\nAnd I ain't gonna lose\n(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)\n[Chorus]\nWe are the champions, my friends\nAnd we'll keep on fighting 'til the end\nWe are the champions\nWe are the champions\nNo time for losers\n'Cause we are the champions\nOf the world\n[Outro]\nWe are the champions, my friends\nAnd we'll keep on fighting 'til the end, oh\nWe are the champions\nWe are the champions\nNo time for losers\n'Cause we are the champions...45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
