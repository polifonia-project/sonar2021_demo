                "The chorus grows out the pre-chorus without almost any contrast in the harmony and the arrangement. The phrasing is A-B-C, and the first two phrases have the same chord progression. The third phrase is the first in the song with non-square phrase length and varied harmonic rhythm. The arrangement adds some guitar chords and synth figures. The last phrase of the section (with the open harmonic shape at both ends) is repeated after the first guitar solo by Brian May. It is followed by a full chorus with tight vocal harmonies and Freddie Mercury\u2019s voice being echoed in the second to last phrase."

The second phrase is extended with a measure with antiphonal vocals and harmonies that are exceptionally tight and harmonious."

                "The hook phrase is repeated eight times, fading out the last few. The first two and the last three phrases have a A-D/A lick from Brian May. Both ascending and descending hocket-like arranged diatonic scales can be heard in the 3rd and 4th phrase and in the second half of the 5th phrase. A Major and D Major scales are played during the measures accompanied with A and D chords respectively. In the last measure of the 5th phrase the two guitar scales go on the contrary direction and cross each other. An ascending guitar harmony that\u2019s completely diatonic plays in the first half of the 5th phrase. The lower two parts ascend stepwise in parallel thirds. The top line ascends irregularly causing some dissonances in the vertical harmonies. The following harmonized scales are heavily chromatic, but the vertical harmonies are all consonant here. Then we reach the slow outro fadeout."

                "This is a square sixteen measure section. The hook itself is the multitrack recorded version of Brian' May\u2019s favorite A-D/A lick. It\u2019s a catchy hook with a distinct tone and played only in the first and third phrases with nothing happening harmonically that\u2019s interesting. The chord progression is the same as in the first two phrases of the chorus (the bass motif is slightly altered though), that\u2019s why it sounds natural that the last phrase of the chorus follows this section. The ending is altered with repeated triplet fills from Brian\u2019s lead guitar solo."

                "Functionally this is a \u201ctypical\u201d short pre-chorus and strangely appears only before the first chorus. The first phrase adds guitar fills. It has two phrases in A-A form and is eight measures long. It is not sharply separated from the neighbor sections except for certain harmonics contrast, as only here you can find minor chords in the song, and there\u2019s no tonic used, which gives this section a bridge flavor. The dominant ending nicely introduces the chorus with tight parallel rising vocal harmonies, even though it starts with the subdominant."

                "There are two verses that are both slightly different.\n\nVerse 1\nThis square twelve measure section consists of three phrases with the same chord progression and even harmonic rhythm. During the phrases, two notes (A and C#) are prolonged. The first verse\u2019s phrasing is A-A-B. The first phrase is accompanied without the rhythm section that enters on the downbeat of the last measure. The third phrase adds arpeggiated guitar chords with a pedal point on top. Note the asymmetric rhythm in the bassline in the last measure. The A melodic phrase is more or less arch-shaped and the B phrase opens up a higher range. Note the exotic diminished triadic figure from Freddie Mercury (\u201cinside your mind\u201d).\n\nVerse 2\nThe second verse adds a single ninth guitar note with oscillating guitar harmonies fading in and out. The last melodic phrase is closed differently than the first verse because it is followed by a different section."
