                "We have three eight-measure verses with an A-A-B-B phrasing. The second and third one is sung an octave higher with incredible energy and funky strummed guitar chords added in contrast with the more economic first verse. The lead tune (in the second verse only) features a \u266d5th, and the bass line also features some chromatic passing notes the last one (A) is copied by the lead vocal. The last measure adds a dissonant guitar chord (G-A#-C-F). The first verse ends with reversed cymbals and the second verse adds more weird noises. Except for the octave-up transposition, the lead tune is also changed. The third verse offers further variants of the lead melody, adding also single-part harmonies."

                "The song starts with the famous two-measure riff played five times, the first two times a variant with an upbeat. The riff uses only three different notes (E, G, A). For the third phase where the main version of the ostinato riff debuts enters the guitar doubling it. The last two phrases add a flanged synth chord (Em7) fading in and abruptly stopped. We then hear the first verse."
