The Beatles famously wrote about this in the song \u201cTaxman\u201d, where they griped about an effective tax rate of 95%. The Kinks also sang about high taxes in \u201cSunny Afternoon\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, Mercury would shortly receive a break from these high tax rates. Just one year after this song was released, newly-elected Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lowered the top income tax rate in the UK from 83% to 60%. Maybe Maggie was a Queen fan."
