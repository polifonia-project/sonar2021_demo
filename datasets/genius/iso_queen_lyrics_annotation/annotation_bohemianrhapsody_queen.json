                "He (Freddie Mercury, as the protagonist-character of the songs), is both lyrically and metaphorically saying goodbye, a decision to go to where no rock/pop song would dare go,\n to \u201cface the truth\", perhaps capital punishment?\n\nThese lines take us closer to the surreality of a case whose jurisdiction is in opera-court drama-Hell, a musical thrill ride, whether perceived as scary, comedic or both, it\u2019s a rhapsodic trip.\n\n\u201cGoodbye \u2026 I\u2019ve got to go\" (to \u201cface the truth\u201d, possibly death!?):\n\nBack to the mundane re-statement of the lines, he must face the repercussions of his crime.  After all, he \u201cjust killed a man\u201d.  Motive?  Pre-meditated? In self-defense?  Or \u2026 (twistedly) suicide?\nIf \u201che\u201d himself was the \u201cman\u201d he killed, metaphorically, then lyrically self-defense is plausible, given the (generally) accepted interpretation of the song.  Suicide might land one in a Hellish after-life, according to, uh, divine laws?  But re-direct: the \u201ckilling\u201d is of a personal false \u201cfacade\u201d and how is that murderous, if the truth sets one (and others) free?  Unless it lands you in jail, like, say, Galileo, who dared to spread his sphere-theory, blasphemous to the false-divinity of flat-earth gravity.\n\nIs \u201cFreddie\u201d off to some sphere of a circuit court, to pull a lyrical joke on us?  Objection! Irrelevant.  It doesn\u2019t matter.  Because \u201cnothing really matters\u201d?  Over-ruled; because later, did the judgy-jurists let him go?  \u2018No, no, no, no, no, no, no!\"\n\nBut \u201cgoodbye everybody\u201d, he\u2019s got to go; i.e., the song must move, conclusively.  The journey proceeds after a few more lyric-lines and past the bridge of Brian May\u2019s first guitar-solo to Freddie\u2019s piano staccatos, into a silhouetted deep dip into a La-La-land of mock-opera (as ode-to opera) madness.   Going there was and remains curious, musically/vocally stunning, and \u2026 risky, in conflated financial and artistic proportions.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, everybody; I\u2019ve got to go \u2026 to face the truth\u201d.  The truth lies in our own choice to shut up or write too much about nothing.\n\nOne verdict could be construed as compensatory damages (back in \u201creality-land\u201d, where money rules):\nRhapsodically, the court of music consumers longing for Bohemia ordained Queen as the people\u2018s band; with this song, Freddie & Co. said \u201cgoodbye\u201d to being \u201cstarving artists\u201d, or rather oddly \u201cstarving rock stars\u201d (an unfair predicament).\n\nCiting the song\u2019s success as some form of lyrical \u201cverdict\u201d is an unsatisfying stretch, true, but this song ran with it.   Within 6-minutes, it (and its album) afforded the band to go globe-trotting, show-stomping from stage to stage, with inevitable \u201cgoodbyes!\u201d to many bodies in between.\n\nIf the wind had blown failure, then to fail BIG would\u2019ve mattered as much to the band.  Goodbye everybody, keep going as if nothing or everything really matters."

                "\u201cMy time has come\u201d is an expression meaning \u201cI\u2019m near the end of my life.\u201d This throws the first verse into sharp relief as the singer says, \u201cI can\u2019t keep writing, I\u2019m about to die.\u201d\n\nIn addition, this whole stanza could be Freddie Mercury emphasizing how he\u2019s going to not only ruin his relationship with his beloved Mary, but also possibly his career by being true to himself as a bi man. If so, then these hyperbolic metaphors here show how possibly ashamed he was to be bisexual, especially coming from a religious family. The success that he had with Queen could have never happened if he publicly came out due to the widespread homophobia at the time."

                "In this line, the persona simultaneously embodies \u201cmonstrosity\u201d and is a victim of it.\n\nExplicitly, the prevailing regressional tone (e.g. \u201cboy\u201d and \u201cmama\u201d) paints him as passive and powerless. In this sense, the line is a third party\u2019s plea to spare an innocent child\u2019s life of great suffering.\n\nConversely, the persona\u2019s parallels with Scaramouche (i.e. a clown with villainous tendencies) coupled with the assertion that \u201cBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\u201d, suggests that he is capable of inflicting great pain and \u2018sin\u2019. Thus, the line presents him as the monster and pertains to either the plea to relieve him from a destructive life or the shame of being perceived as a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d (i.e. the metaphor serves to portray how alienated he feels).\n\nThe duality of being may serve to portray the conflict between societal perceptions (that perceive him as a monster) and true character, stemming from various zeitgeists/prejudices. The disconnect seems to alienate the persona and contributes to his figurative and/or literal demise.\n\n\n\nScaramouche"

                "In describing oneself as a \u201cboy\u201d, the persona perceives himself as lacking power and control over his life. In contrast, a mother is often the co-determinant of her son\u2019s early wellbeing. Thus, as the adult persona emotionally regresses to a deeply helpless state, he turns once-again to his \u2018mother\u2019 (\u201cMama\u201d). Here, the maternal figure is symbolic of all factors possessing a perceived total-influence over his life (e.g. nature, leaders, assigned spiritual figures, parental figures etc.). He begs them to utilize their control to steer him to solace."

                "The persona\u2019s passivity in the prior lines is strengthened by his perception of self; whereby, describing oneself as a \u201cboy\u201d represents his regression to a helpless state. The inclusion of \u201cjust\u201d further informs his perceived insignificance.\n\nNevertheless, the persona qualifies this representation, expressing that an acknowledgement of his deeply helpless situation is not accompanied by self-pity (he is undesiring of \u201csympathy\u201d). Instead, he copes by adopting a passive outlook (represented by \u201ceasy come, easy go\u201d) and ultimately abandons the desire and hope to influence his life.\n\nSuch surrendering could be representational of the K\u00fcbler-Ross Grief Cycle\u2019s final stage (i.e.acceptance)  to which the persona accepts a new way of life in light of great previous loss/suffering."

                "To be \u201ccaught in a landslide\u201d is to be trapped within the settled rubble proceeding the natural disaster. Explicitly, landslides are great displacements of mass (e.g. soil, rock) on a mountain/cliff; thus representing burdensome and overwhelming experiences in the persona\u2019s life. In being trapped, the persona is powerless and cannot change his situation.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite not being able to move (cannot \u201cescape\u201d), he can still look-up and appreciate the \u201cskies\u201d. This is not only representative of his passivity, whereby he is inclined to observe instead of influence (further strengthened by \u201ceasy come, easy go\u201d) but also regards the ways in which he copes in moments of adversity. \u201cLook[ing] up to the skies\u201d could refer to an innate appreciation of beauty and/or gratitude, a connection with nature, spiritual influence etc. that moderately alleviates his suffering. Via such mechanisms, he suggests that one can \u201copen\u201d their \u201ceyes\u201d; representing attainment of significant insight and perspective.\n\nInterestingly, the persona\u2019s admiration of nature despite it also being the compromising force is a further nod to the persona\u2019s outlook. Despite nature\u2019s monstrous capabilities he prefers to appreciate the beauty within it."

                "This line refers to the ambiguity surrounding the persona\u2019s new identity as he figuratively dies (\u201cgoodbye everybody\u201d), leaving his old self behind. \u201cSilhouett[es]\u201d by definition are vague outlines that represent such uncertainty, while \u201clittle\u201d could refer to the lacking agency he has over his life. Additionally, the backing light of a silhouette could express the hope associated with this new chapter.\n\nFurthermore, the line likely depicts the \u201cScaramouche\u201d of the proceeding line (i.e. a clown of early 16th-century professional theatre possessing some villainous qualities). Therefore, the silhouette could simultaneously depict the persona and the Scaramouche, highlighting his perceived similarities with the clown.\n\nInterestingly (but perhaps unrelated), Scaramouche was often beaten by Harlequin (another 16th-century character) for his \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cboasting\u201d nature. Perhaps, the persona compares his own societal subjugation to that of the relationship between Scaramouche and Harlequin.\n\n\n\nFrom \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 official music video\n\n\n\nHarlequin and Scaramouche representation"

                "The intro starts with tight acapella harmonies, all multi-tracked by Freddie Mercury. The leading part is the second from top, as it is usual in barbershop harmonies. The harmony during the \u201ceasy come\u2026\u201d part is only three-parted, and this is the motif that will show up in the opera section in both this and an altered form. The rubato-flavor of the first phrase originates from the syncopations without rhythmic backing and the 9/8 meter. The latter switches to 4/4 for the second phrase. Let\u2019s go through every phrase of this intro:\n\nFirst Phrase\nThe first phrase features a chain of fifths root-motion with heavy use of seventh chords.\n\nSecond Phrase\nIn the second phrase enters the piano that features pre-downbeat accents (on the word \u201csee\u201d) followed by an on-downbeat entrance of a piano motif that is a shortened version of what will close the first verse, but also will show up in the outro (both in E\u266d Major).\n\nThird Phrase\nThis phrase features chromatic oscillation around the tonic in a modified form, that will recur in the opera section. The progression has a vague \u201cIV-I-V-I\u201d flavor created by the cross relations of E\u266d-D and A-B\u266d. The open ending is nicely resolved by the opening chord of the next section.\n\nFourth Phrase\nThis begins the opening arpeggiated piano riff, the same that starts the verse and features appoggiatura on the 6th degree. On the downbeat enters the bass, and then begins the first verse."

The solo is played in the key of E\u266d Major and features a screechy, shimmering tone Brian managed to pull off using a Vox AC30 amplifier, bassist John Deacon\u2019s \u201cDeacy amp\u201d, and multiple treble boosters. The solo was marked one of the greatest guitar solos in history and has topped multiple greatest guitar solo lists. The guitar screams out crying notes in the upper register, resulting in an undeniable lead tone that was a trademark of Brian\u2019s playing."
