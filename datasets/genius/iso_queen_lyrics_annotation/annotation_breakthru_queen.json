                "The song has one bridge, or pre-chorus, plus an instrumental one for the guitar solo by Brian May. The hook is played until the third phrase where John Deacon enters on bass. Here is the only phrase in the song with uneven length, albeit the vocal phrase overlaps the next phrase. The vocal phrases in both the first two harmonic phrases consist of a harmony vocal and solo vocal subphrases from Freddie Mercury. We then break back into the second verse."

                "We have three choruses, the second and third of which are doubling up the first eight measures. The oscillating hook is carried on throughout the whole section. The second chorus adds oscillating vocal harmonies introducing the double-up subsection. After the first chorus, we reach a short pre-chorus or bridge."

                "There are two verses that consist of five four-measure phrases in A-A-A-B-B form. The dramatic bow of the verse is rising parallel with the lead vocal from the fourth phrase on, leading to the climactic chorus. Note the built-in chromatic motion in the last measures. The pedal bass in the first four phrases is articulated by the repetition of the main hook. In the fourth phrase, the hook-variant uses tritone intervals for the tension-creating effect. The second verse adds lead guitar fills filling Freddie Mercury\u2019s gaps."

                "Part 1\nPart one starts with an economic bass solo of three different notes by John Deacon over the synth bass hook in the background. The third phrase on guitar is the lead instrument, which starts with unison bent notes. Brian May also creates a pair of phrases both playing ascending scales in triplets, such as in \u201cWhite Queen (As it Began)\u201d.\n\nPart 2\nThe next part is modified and adds an extra phrase of guitar harmonies paralleling the previous phrase a half step higher preparing the key shift-up. The closing \u266dIII chord creates a feel of further modulation but we stay in F# until the end of the song."

                "The intro vocal performance was a separate song written by Freddie Mercury called \u201cNew Life Is Born\u201d. It starts acapella with five vocal overdubs, all multitracked (Roger Taylor, Freddie Mercury, Brian May) with Freddie\u2019s voice being solo. The vocal harmonies are heavily jazzy and tight and display some of the band\u2019s best vocal harmonies. A piano joins in and the song is now F Major."
