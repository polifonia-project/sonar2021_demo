Three of Queen\u2019s more repetitive songs \u2013  \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d (1977), \u201cAnother One Bites The Dust\u201d (1980), and \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d (1980) \u2013 were their most successful songs in the US. Their much less repetitive worldwide hit \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d (1975), however, only reached a Number 9 position on the US charts in 1976 (No2 in 1992!), while more repetitive Number 1 disco hits  (\u201cThat\u2019s The Way (I Like It)\u201d (1975) by KC and the Sunshine Band and \u201cFly Robin Fly\u201d (1975) by the Silver Convention ) set the trend at that time. \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d, Queen\u2019s collaboration with David Bowie, reached a low Number 29 on the US charts in 1982, while the record was a Number 1 hit in the UK.  \u201cInnuendo\u201d had similar story (No 1 vs. No chart appearance). These three songs show that the US single market was not ideal place for Queen\u2019s non-repetitive songs. The famous riff of \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d later on returned in a repetitive context as the sample hook in Vanilla Ice\u2019s pop-rap hit \u201cIce Ice Baby\u201d, an US Number 1 in 1990 and also a telling and extreme example of \u201cless  is more\u201d \u2013 on the charts at least."
