                "This guitar solo caused plenty of contention between Freddie and fellow bandmate Brian May. Originally, May wanted nothing to do with the song, but Freddie Mercury managed to convince him to add at least a guitar solo in it. Upon closer listening, one will note this is the only part of the song that has any guitar parts at all."

But as everyone knows, everything has to come to an end, or in this case a \u2018collision course\u2019 which would later see Freddie Mercury being diagnosed and eventually dying from HIV/AIDS.\n\n\nAccording to his partner Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS shortly after Easter of 1987\n\nOn the evening of 24 November 1991, a little over 24 hours after issuing that statement, Mercury died at the age of 45 at his home in Kensington.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, he and Queen as a whole just kept going \u2013 getting greater, bigger and better. And more ironic is , following the diagnosis and death of Freddie Mercury \u2013 both Queen and Freddie became even more successful.\n\nBrian May also named an asteroid after Freddie on September 5th, 2016, to celebrate his 70th birthday."

Fahrenheit can also be taken as a pun, due to its pronunciation of \u201cheit\u201d as \u201cheight\u201d, referring to the measurement of two hundred degrees.\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that Freddie\u2019s full name, Freddie Mercury, has an element which was used in thermometers for about three centuries. Also, Mercury was the messenger of the gods, renowned for his speed. The speed of matter is also roughly analogous to its temperature."
