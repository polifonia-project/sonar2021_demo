                "On the studio version,  Freddie Mercury sings the intro and chorus while his voice is harmonised with an upper voice (Roger Taylor) and a lower voice (Brian May). Despite being harder to pull off live, the band would still attempt their trickery, often with Brian singing lead in the chorus.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWLdiw0sKg0"

                "Prior to the release of Jazz,, Queen had already been on several tours throughout the UK, and even the US for their News Of The World album tour. Brian May, who wrote the track, is simply stating how these experiences with the band have led him to see many different women who he describes as \u201cfloozies\u201d. Floozy is an often derogatory term for people who are boastful about their sexual relations with other people."

                "This references the song \u201cBicycle Race\u201d, also from Jazz, which in turn references this song. The two songs were released together as a \u2018Double A-side\u2019 single.\n\nThe original cover for the single was a photo of a fully nude woman riding a bicycle, but many stores refused to sell it. The recording company released an alternate cover with panties painted on.\n\nIn turn of this song referencing it, Bicycle Race also refers Fat Bottomed Girls:\n\nFat bottomed girls will be riding today, so look out for those beauties oh yeah."
