                "The song has six choruses: Two of them build an instrumental outro; another two make a couplet before the outro, with the sections being seven measures long. The guitar (partly reinforced by the bass) plays a chromatic line that drives the harmony. Even the tonic (G) sounds like a passing chord. The harmonic rhythm is constant: Two chords per measure until the last two chords where it slows down. The ii-V progression that closes the preceding verses and converges to the tonic doesn\u2019t get resolved as the chorus begins with the subdominant chord. Compared to the verses, the arrangement is joined by synth and distorted guitar; the piano is hardly heard.\n\n\n\nAs for the backing vocals, the popular gradual thickening is used. The first chorus adds just short pieces of doubletracking to the lead vocal, and the second chorus adds vocal harmonies at its ending. The third and fourth choruses add backing harmonies to each title phrase, lead guitar figures, and Freddie Mercury drops in some extra syncopations and a triplet for climactic effect. The synth plays broken chords throughout the choruses. In the second measure of the third chorus, the \u201cchromatic\u201d guitar jumps up to B instead of E. The next chorus here has a short guitar figure. Roger Taylor holds pause at the end of the first three choruses to create a touch of tension."

                "The verse is square eight measures long and the first phrase uses the six diatonic Major/minor chords. The first two measures have the Queen-clich\u00e9: I-V-vi progression with the step-wise descending bass. The D-chord in measure 4 gets descending parallel thirds. During measures 5-6 the lead vocal executes a chromatic rise from D to F. Remember that the Intro (the variant of this passage) operated with a descending guitar tune. The harmonic rhythm slows down at the end of both phrases. The first verse starts only with bass, drums, and piano which back the lead vocal. The second phrase\u2019s first-half adds clean guitar chords. Measure 7 adds a strange guitar noise: Brian May picks the strings over the bridge, which he also does several times later in the song. The last measure adds distorted guitar introducing the climactic chorus.\n\n\n\nIn the second verse the guitar is played differently: It enters earlier in the first phrase, produces more of those strange noises, and uses a Wah-Wah pedal on the chords from measure 3 on. Freddie Mercury adds a seventh to the G chord in measure two."

                "It\u2019s three measures long, but at its end, it flows into the verse. The harmony of the first two measures is taken from the mid part of the verses; the third measure starts a double plagal cadence (IV-of-IV-IV-I). The harmony is created by the piano and synth. The lead guitar tune starts with descending chromatic couplets: B-B\u266d A-A\u266d G-G\u266dF-E, with the bass creating a nice counterpoint. The modal flat 7th (F) appears both in the lead part and in the harmony. The second iteration of the Intro adds an Am chord, which makes the hook half a measure longer, with the lead guitar holding a pause during the Am chord."
