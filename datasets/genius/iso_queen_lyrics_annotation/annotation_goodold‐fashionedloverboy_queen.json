                "After the bridge, we go into a guitar solo from Brian May. The guitar solo is not just one of Brian\u2019s most melodic but also one of his most sophisticated arrangements with antiphonally alternating harmonies. Among the guitar harmonies, we can find simple inversion-changing ones and some tightly harmonized melodies, all these spiced with stereo imaging and with the sweet tone of his signature guitar, the Red Special. After the guitar solo, we break back into the third verse."
