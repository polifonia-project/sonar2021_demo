                "The last chorus is followed by an outro section where the backing track (with little modification) repeats the verse progression five times. The last of these features that characteristic quick stop on \u201c2-and\u201d. Towards the last line, Freddie Mercury sings falsetto (reaching an A note), and the guitar riff plays also one octave higher than before. The last chord is ringed throughout with feedback, with Roger Taylor pounding some drum fills, John Deacon does some bass runs and Freddie\u2019s shouts close the song."

                "After the bridge, we reach a long instrumental section with two guitar solos from Brian May.\n\nPart 1\nThe first part phrasing of the backing track is A-A-A and the two measure guitar solo enters on the downbeat of the second phrase. The chord progression drives the harmony towards a modally inflected B or E Major. The pitch set of the solo is A major with the occasional feature of the modal flat-7th (G). The tonic role of A is very weak due to the short air-time it gets and the way it seems to be a transition chord between G5 and B(5). The rhythm uses patterned off-beat accents. Note the last notes of this segment of the solo where the C# gets a \u201cclean\u201d C ornament into part two.\n\nPart 2\nThis eight-measure section hijacks the harmony from A Major to C Major. Pumping pedal-point on C is played throughout the whole section without chordal support. The tone set of the lead guitar part is mostly Mixolydian C Major, but we can find occasional flat-3rd degree too. The pre-solo (which is not melodic enough to be a real solo) is ascending in flavor except for the descending ending. Every note is an appoggiatura in the context of the basal C chord, and this is what creates the unresolved feeling that motivates the solo to move on higher and higher. Roger Taylor spices this section with some asymmetric patterns into the final section.\n\nPart 3\nThis final section is another guitar solo played over the chorus progression and extended by our measures. The ending of the solo is reminiscent of the original lead vocal melody. The first of the four additional measures repeats the previous one and the second one is in 6/8. The last two leave the section open on IV (D). Compared to the other choruses, the backing vocals are modified in the second phrase."

                "The phrasing of this bridge is A-A-B and the second half of the A phrases are sung in harmony. Fingerpicked guitars can be heard in the first half-phrases. The harmony is open at both ends in each phrase and the gravity-center of the lead vocal shifts to a higher level. Note the seventh in the bass in the last measure. The chords are played in eighths before the downbeats; moreover, the harmony singing has a disorienting off-beat rhythm. We then hear a guitar solo by Brian May after this bridge."

                "The square eight-measure chorus is almost like the second half of the verse, with different articulation in the vocal harmonies, legato guitar chords contrasting with some staccato D/A chords in the verses. The phrasing is A-A where the lead vocal of the second half-phrase is varied for the second time. The half-phrasing is in A-B-A-B form. The second half phrase mirrors the chord progression of the first. The three-part vocal harmony is pretty simple: it strictly follows the chord progression, and the lead part is in the middle."

                "Like the intro, the eighth-measure verse has two phrases with the same backing track. The lead melody has an A-B-C-B form and the backing track has an A-A-A-B form, with the harmony of the phrases closed at both ends. The lead vocal is pentatonic and the range is only one octave, still, we can find octave steps in the lead vocal. The second verse adds a chordal synth track, and during the last verse the synth is mixed down, the guitar is played in a muted style, while the bass stays throughout on pedal A. This subdued arrangement makes the last chorus \u201cexplode\u201d."

                "The intro is the instrumental version of the verse: two iterations of the four-measure main riff. The first one features the double-tracked hard rocking rhythm guitars with drum hits on the 4th beats and the second phrase adds bass and hi-hats. The main riff uses accented eighths, and the famous Brian May guitar lick: A-D/A chord change. The second phrase features guitar pedal bass on A, with a I-IV-V progression. We then hear the first verse."
