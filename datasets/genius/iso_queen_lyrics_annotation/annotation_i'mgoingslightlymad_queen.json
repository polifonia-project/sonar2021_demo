                "The verses are a square sixteen measures long followed by a two bar instrumental connector. The phrase structure is A-B-A-B-C-D-C-D-I harmony wise, melody wise it is more variant, also between the cycles. The rhythm track carries throughout a constant 8/8 pulsing while the lead vocal is flexibly rhythmized often using triplets. From here on the key is ambiguous. The F# and G chords weakly suggest a B minor key which is the relative minor key of the D Major key where we eventually arrive. The second verse adds tight backing vocal harmonies during the second subsection. The third verse that follows the solo omits the first eight measures. The instrumental closing phrase shifts the key up by one whole step. The arpeggios here are doubled with sampled vocal synths."

                "After the second chorus, we break into a slide guitar solo from Brian May. Brian solo\u2019s over the chorus progression, even the first few notes quote the original lead vocal melody. The slide playing varies in tempo, tone, and range position. The distorted part of the solo is heavy with loud amplification. It returns to the quiet slide solo, before returning to the third verse."

The second cycle is also introduced with a two-bar shortened variant of the intro with more chimes. The outro is a closer variant of the intro. The synth part goes D minor to D minor/F to D minor/A."

During the second subsection, the harmony has no established center. The F chord doesn\u2019t sound like either of a \u266dIII-of-D, IV-of-C, or the new tonic chord. The first chorus is followed by a short re-intro. The second chorus closes with a one-measure D minor chord which is followed by the opening D chord of the guitar solo by Brian May. The last chorus doubles up the last vocal phrase before the outro, with guitar  tremolo picked glissando\u2019s and echoed vocal parts by Freddie Mercury."

He screamed when they came up with things like \u2018I\u2019m knitting with only one needle\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m driving on only three wheels these days\u2019.
