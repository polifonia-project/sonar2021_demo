                "The chorus is sixteen measures long with square, A-B-A-C phrasing.\n\nPart 1\nThe modality is mixed: The lead vocal features both natural, flat 7th, and Major thirds. The rhythm guitar plays flat 7ths and flat 3rds. The second half of the section omits the tonic. The phrase-long prolonged tonic chord in the last phrase gets no resolution, instead of that the harmony returns to E on the last beat of the section. The sung phrases are completed with guitar motifs, similarly as in \u201cWe Are The Champions\u201d.\n\nPart 2\nVariants (besides subtle melodic changes) are in the second and third choruses, where it resolves to A instead of E on a deceptive cadence. The latter chorus ending is also the ending of the song, and the third chorus is cleverly extended: Two extra phrases are added that are variants of the first two and the third phrase adds cascaded harmonies. The next phrase is chord-wise and lyrics-wise more or less identical with the \u201coriginal\u201d, but the lead melody is subtly varied with an additional echo device.\n\nPart 3\nThe rest of the section is doubled up in length compared to the first choruses. Melodically the two inner sub-phrases are the \u201cextra\u201d ones the second of which is instrumental, as lead guitar enters on the downbeat of the second sub-phrase. The A\u266d Phrygian scale provides a tonic favor to the A\u266d chord. The descending solo by Brian May is filled with many step-wise ornaments and fast arpeggios. The song closes deceptively on A5. The guitar chord (second inversion: A5/E) fades into feedback harmony that distantly resonates with the intro of the song."

                "There are three verses, that all have square phrasing. Compared to the latter, the arrangement drops the lead guitar. The mode is Phrygian with occasional Ionian (Major scale) infections (2nd and 3rd degrees in measures four and eight). The melody oscillates around the 1st degree resonating with the \u201cSpanish\u201d ornament associated with the flamenco style. Note the extensive use of melodic (and rhythmic) variants in the three verses in every four phrases. The second half of the section parallels the first one a Major third higher. It\u2019s mainly a key shift from E to G#. The Ionian infection (B\u266d, C) at the end helps to modulate the IV key (D\u266d Major) into the chorus."

                "After the second bridge, we break into an instrumental break. The main riff is exactly the same as the Spanish guitar section, only electrified in a hard rock style. The riff is a chromatically descending riff in 5/4. Similar to the \u201cSpanish\u201d section, the first phrase has a single-tracked lead guitar, the second phrase adds a harmony guitar below that, and the third phrase adds an extra lead guitar backed by the harmony guitars. Brian May\u2019s sheer power and sound on his lead playing is unrivaled. Roger Taylor\u2019s drumming increases in intensity with bombastic fills. Both this section and the acoustic solo end with a descending figure, exploding on a low E note. We explode seamlessly into the third verse."

                "Following the acoustic guitar piece by Steve Howe, we break into an operatic bridge in \u00be. The arch-shaped non-syncopated lead melody from Freddie Mercury suits well with the synth-orchestration by David Richards. The first two phrases have a single voice, and the rest of the section is harmonized. In the third phrase the vocal harmonies alternate the inversion of the same chord, A minor. The fourth phrase parallels the third, but the harmonies here alternate chords. The last phrase prolongs a BVI chord providing a special ending to this special section. The G# chord is resolved to A minor through a diminished seventh chord. Then we break into an instrumental section."

                "After the second chorus, we break into a short bridge. As the final A5 fermata chord fades away, then starts the interlude with a placid theme dominated by two acoustic guitars, one playing arpeggios, and one playing open chords. We seamlessly shift to A Aeolian. The echoed vocals appear, and the guitar mimics Freddie Mercury\u2019s words. Brian May starts playing a chromatic chord progression, as harmonized vocals mimic the final guitar chords. We then break into Steve Howe\u2019s acoustic guitar solo."

                "The song starts with a snare drumroll and Freddie Mercury\u2019s slow count-in. On the opening downbeat enters, the bass (and synth in octaves) as Roger Taylor plays bolero-esque rhythm figures on his snare drums. The synth and bass\u2019s dissonant chords foreshadow the Phrygian mode (in this case E) of the \u201cSpanish\u201d interlude. The intro is thickened by rhythm guitars fading in and fading to feedback harmonics, as we move to G# Phrygian. After a short guitar lick, we explode into the main theme of the song, as we move back to E Phrygian. Roger plays a straight-forward 4/4 beat and the bass pummels E. The main riff mixes chromatic notes with distorted E5 chords. Then begins the first verse."
