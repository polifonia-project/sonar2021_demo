                "The outro is developed from the extended third chorus. The melody rises from the second phrase on reaching a climax on the downbeat where the outro starts. Harmony-wise it is almost like a slow-down version of the ending of the second chorus. The outro repeats the intro hook six times, then only slow dyads (B\u266d1/A\u266d) are played starting on the third beat of the sixth repetition of the hook."

                "The twenty-measure chorus has two subsections (A-A) plus an instrumental break with two jingling guitar chords. The harmony is very basic except for the semi-chromatic ascending figure closing the first subsection. The harmony of the second subsection is altered and extended. The last melodic phrase ends on the downbeat of the last harmonic phrase. The IV-\u266dIII figure with pedal bass strongly resonates with the intro hook. In the second chorus, the closing chord is D\u266dE\u266d and the first harmonic phrase is altered, but the backing vocals sing the original melody. The semichromatic figure is completed with chords this time. The third chorus lets you hear the backing guitar harmony arrangement much better."

                "After the second chorus, we break into an instrumental section, with a guitar solo by Brian May.\n\nPart 1\n The first two measures are arrangement-wise extending the piano closing of the preceding second chorus. The harmony suggests a C minor tonality for the first two phrases. The third phrase adds guitar harmony chords followed by stepwise moving lead guitar figures turning antiphonal for the fourth phrase which ends with a long ascending scale in fast triplets. For the last phrase the guitar is harmonized and also some vocal harmony chords are added. The key modulates to the relative Major key of E\u266d. Harmony-wise the fourth phrase parallels the third one with the I-V6/3-vi clich\u00e9.\n\nPart 2\nThe prolonged dominant ending of the previous section does not resolve to the tonic but to the subdominant. The tonic role of the E\u266d is not very convincing due to the inverted voicing and also the harmonic similarity with the pre-chorus, which suggests here A\u266d is the key. On the other hand, the catchy lead tune (featuring D instead of D\u266d) suggests E\u266d Major, which modulates the neighbor B\u266d Major, where the lead guitar gets harmonized. The last phrase of the melodic guitar solo is a May-esque descending figure."

                "The twelve measure pre-chorus has three phrases in an A-A-B form, where the B is in fact the extension of A. The music modulates to the neighbor key E\u266d Major. The first two phrases re-use the I-V6/3-vi clich\u00e9 followed by a iii chord reminiscent of \u201cGood Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\u201d. Every three phrases of the second pre-chorus are melodically changed. In the last harmonic phrase the B melodic phrase is followed by yet another melodic phrase with a rising shape. Here Brian May plays a step-wise oscillating figure on the guitar."

The second melodic phrase closes on a dissonant note (4th degree). In contrast with the second verse which is backed by a proper drumbeat, the first verse has no drumbeat just ad-lib played cymbals. The second verse adds some single-part backing vocals."

The chords suggest G minor to be the opening key but the harmony does not resolve to its tonic but to that of B\u266d Major. The second part of the intro is a piano hook played twice, before the start of the first verse."
