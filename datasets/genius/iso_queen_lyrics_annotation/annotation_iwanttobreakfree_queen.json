                "This bridge is thirteen measures long with square phrasing. As typical for bridges, the harmony steers away from the tonic. In the last three phrases the harmony lands on the tonic after two \u201cfailed attempts\u201d on its relative minor chord. This bridge uses the IV-vi-V/V(sus4-3)-IV-V-I chord progression in E Major."

                "There are three verses and the harmony follows the 12 bar blues clich\u00e9. The thing that prevents it from sounding even remotely generic is its avoidance of blues (no shuffle beat, no blue notes), its rhythm, and its clever melody development.\n\nVerse 1\nThe second vocal phrase is a close variant of the first and the third phrase is an extended variant of the first one where the extension is repeated with another extension repeating a descending scale fragment four times with staccato odd-rhythms. The fourth phrase is a mirror-variant of the first. The rest of the section is not a variant of the earlier phrases. The rhythm department makes use of triplets, and staccato notes (first phrase).\n\nVerse 2\nThe second verse is slightly different. Its second phrase (\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d) is an extended variant of the first where the extension (love for\u2026) is repeated (\u201cthis time\u2026\u201d) and altered and extended. A very similar technique was used during the first verse, but the target is different. This similarity is too subtle of detail to treat as a unifying element. The rest of the section is not altered much and it closes with guitar harmonies leading into the bridge.\n\nVerse 3\nThe third verse is altered except for the first melodic phrase and the last harmonic phrase. The last harmonic phrase is repeated."

                "This could be seen as a very literal statement that he has truly fallen in love, and the all knowing (God) can confirm that.\n\nSince this song has seen widespread adoption by the LGBT community, this line has also been interpreted as reference to those who oppose their community under the name of God. People say the Devil is the one who makes people gay. However, the narrator is implying that even God knows they\u2019ve fallen in love, saying God is the one who made them this way. This is similar to the last line when he says \u201cGod knows I want to break free\u201d."

                "The line seems to indicate that the narrator has fallen in love before, but those times it wasn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d.\n\nIt is likely this line is made slightly tongue-in-cheek. If this is the first time the narrator has actually been in love, how does he know what love feels like? He doesn\u2019t have any reference by which to know that this love is \u201creal\u201d. What will make this time different to the other times he\u2019s been in love and (apparently) been wrong? It is possible that here the narrator is convincing himself that he\u2019s in love because he wants it to be real and \u201cthis time\u201d he\u2019s going to be right about it.\n\nAlternatively, this may be viewed as the narrator beginning to learn to love themselves, where they\u2019ve previously been in a life where they don\u2019t value themselves and their own need to do what they want, they are too busy trying to satisfy everyone else\u2019s expectations."

                "The narrator says that he has fallen in love. He may have had relationships before, but it wasn\u2019t love, and therefore this feels like it\u2019s the first time. This love is often interpreted as the narrator\u2019s first homosexual relationship and why it feels so different, despite Freddie Mercury\u2019s statement that this was a song written by a very straight man, insinuating he saw it as more likely to be a heterosexual love.\n\nAlternatively, this may be a love of oneself, accepting who you are, regardless of what other\u2019s expect or demand of you, the choice to be yourself and free yourself from your own doubts.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xOhAHdF96E&feature=youtu.be&t=347"

                "There are many interpretations of these iconic opening lines. Due to the band members dressing in drag in the video, many people associate it with a person coming out as gay, lesbian, bisexual or trans, hence the \u2018your lies\u2019, where the \u2018your\u2019 could be referring to the conservative society and the \u2018lies\u2019 could be the \u2018homosexuality and transsexualism is a sin\u2019 ideology people had back in the 80s.\n\n\n\nA less deep interpretation is a more literal one, suggesting that the song could be the narrator telling their significant other they feel trapped in their relationship due to a relationship of lies.\n\nDespite most people believing that the former interpretation is correct due to Freddie Mercury\u2019s own association with the LGBT community (sources conflict on whether he was bisexual or gay), Freddie Mercury strongly denies these claims. Indeed, when asked if the song was dedicated to the gay community, he replied:\n\nTo start off with, that song was written by John Deacon, you know, and, he\u2019s a very happily married man with about four children\u2026 It\u2019s got nothing to do with the gay people at all, it\u2019s basically about everybody, it\u2019s just somebody who has a very tough life and he just wants to break free from whatever problems he\u2019s got. It\u2019s got nothing to do with the gay thing."
