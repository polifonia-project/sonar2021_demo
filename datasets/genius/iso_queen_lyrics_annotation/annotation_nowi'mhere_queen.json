                "Following the second chorus, we break into a guitar solo from Brian May. Brian solo\u2019s over the \u266dVII of B Mixolydian. Along with the rocking and rumbling piano lines from Freddie Mercury, the solo features lots of double stops in the vein of Chuck Berry. After the solo, we break into a short bridge, and into the third verse."

                "Part 1\nThe song starts with 1/8 pulsing guitar power chords exposing the opening tonic of D. Freddie Mercury enters with the vocals that are heavily delayed and start on the upbeat that ends on the 1/8 preceding the opening downbeat of the related harmonic phrase. Each vocal delay extends the first. Note that the \u201caround around around\u2026\u201d words all fall off-beat despite they first sound deceptively on-beat. The harmony combines the D major chord created by the echoed lead vocal and the guitar power chords with the descending bass line.\n\nPart 2\nWe then explode into a second section of the intro that prepares the modulation to E Major. The melodic phrasing is interesting: The shouted upbeat ends just before the opening downbeat and lyrical-wise it remains unresolved. The tension is supported by the sus4 dissonances and the step-up modulation. Additional varispeed guitar screams are echoed, similarly to the intro vocals, as heavily harmonized vocals enter, just before the main riff enters."
