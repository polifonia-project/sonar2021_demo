            [
                "In terms of functional harmony this chorus seems rather like a bridge, but it\u2019s not sharply separated from the verse. The bassline in the first two phrases uses a motif reminiscent of one in \u201cA Kind Of Magic\u201d and the phrasing is in A-A-B form. More precisely transcribed, the first A note is still in the previous measure. In the first cycle it is directly preceded by another off-beat downward scale featuring the blue note (E\u266d-E). The lead vocal of the first chorus is two part harmonized, a third lower throughout. The second chorus alters the B melodic phrase (it starts two steps higher). The first phrase of the third chorus is not harmonized and the second phrase is shifted up, while its harmony part remains the original lead part.\n\n\n\nThe third phrase is altered and extended. The oscillating \u201cwo-wo-yeah\u201d phrase is three-part harmonized this time. The first two phrases of the fourth chorus are just like in the first chorus with guitar harmonies added in the background and the rest of the section is completely changed melody-wise although the harmony remains a variant. The last phrase features an interesting echo antiphony and closes with the legendary \u201cfried chicken\u201d words. The chromatic lick is executed twice expanding the figure from one to three measures. Its rhythm is more straightforward than it first sounds. The song then comes to a close."

                "After the bridge, we have a long semi-instrumental interlude. The main ingredients are synth drums, a faint synth part centered to A, and lead guitar fills. These lead guitar fills are done not in Brian May\u2019s usual melodic approach. The B\u266d chord sounds like the familiar B\u266d/D chord as the lead guitar plays unison bends combined with tremolo picking on the D note. We then break back into the outro chorus."

                "The verses are built on the close rhythmic variant of the opening exposed guitar hook. Later verses add more variants. The first verse contains three, the other verses contain two riff phrases. The lead vocal frequently uses bluesy flat thirds. The third melodic phrase ends differently than the first two (A-A-A), closing with three-part harmonized title words. The second verse alters the lead melody but its rhythm remains the same for most of the time. The first riff ends with a different fill. The first half of the third verse is completely changed melody-wise and also the rhythm guitar track closes with new figures. The second half is a melodic variant of the opening half-verse while the rhythm guitar track adds here another new riff."

                "After the bridge, we break into a guitar solo from Brian May. The solo is played over the main riff before the third verse. Brian uses the tapping technique the first time on a record since \u201cIt\u2019s Late\u201d. The tapping part of the solo is triplet-driven with lots of chromatic steps. Brian also plays squelching bends with lots of distortion. We then break back into the third verse."

                "This intro can be divided into three subsections:\n\nSubsection 1\nThis first subsection is a roster of psychedelic noises achieved by tape trickery using techniques such as slowdowns, reverse plays, and harmonizers on voices.\n\nSubsection 2\nThe second subsection consists of five phrases with pedal bass that starts with a 1-\u266d2-1-\u266d7-1 ornament. Rhythm tracks enter in the second phrase. The third phrase adds synth and guitar glissandos. In the fourth phrase, the pedal bass adds a synth hook played by Brian May. The pedal bass combined with parallel sixth motion is a trademark of his, seen in examples like \u201cDoing Alright\u201d. The last phrase of the synth hook subsection uses borrowed chords. The B\u266d/D chord is also a late-period May trademark. Synth arpeggios are added that are probably sequenced or speed-up. It\u2019s not an arpeggiator as the arpeggio cycles are changing both shape-wise and length-wise. Beside the B\u266d triads, the arpeggios are enriched with second and seventh degrees. The final sustained chord is unresolved, creating lots of tension for the start of the next subsection.\n\nSubsection 3\nThe last subsection of the intro exposes the four-measure main guitar hook of the verses three times. The entrance of the guitars is extremely impulsive due to some well-placed rakes. The second phrase adds bass, drums, and lead guitar. The first verse is then heard."

                "Here Freddie muses about the whole world living as one: the One Vision this song preaches in which everyone is the same and there\u2019s no reason for people to struggle against each other because of their differences.\n\nBut he refers to it as a \u201csweet illusion\u201d even as he begins to describe it, and the bridge closes out with him acknowledging reality has fallen short.  The last line here, \u201cLook what they\u2019ve done to my dream\u201d in unclear as to whether his (one) vision has simply been rudely discarded and trampled on, or perverted into monstrous and totalitarian conformity."

                "The bridge of this song was inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s I Have a Dream speech, as confirmed by drummer Roger Taylor, who wrote the track. The first lyric in the bridge: \u201cI had a dream\u201d, parallels the repeated phrase \u201cI have a dream\u201d in Dr. King\u2019s speech."

                "Such a socially conscious song ends on quite the unexpected note, begging the listener for fried chicken. This humorous line unexpectedly came from Freddie Mercury\u2019s husband, Jim Hutton. In his book \u201cMercury and Me\u201d, Hutton admits that he suggested the line about fried chicken as a joke, telling them that Queen was a big enough band to pull off a ridiculous line such as that. Much to his surprise however, it made the final cut."
