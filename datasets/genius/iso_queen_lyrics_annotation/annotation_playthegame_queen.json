                "After the bridge, we enter an instrumental break.\n\nPart 1\nThe first part plays over the verse progression and is dominated by a guitar playing along with the chromatic descent. Synth glissando figures are added where the guitar holds the note. This hard section is \u201cresolved\u201d by substituting the rhythm guitar with piano in the next section.\n\nPart 2\nThis part plays over the chorus progression with a guitar solo by Brian May. Note how the noisy preparation switches to a mellow piano-driven accompaniment. The first two notes of the solo are a recurrent element of May\u2019s soloing: A note followed by a long bend. The solo is not speedy and it presents another possible lead vocal melody. We then go back into the chorus."

                "After the second chorus, we break into a short bridge, that has a double-time feel.  Note the effect when the staccato fill changes to legato in measure three. The metric frame is distorted here, where the 1/8 pulse is slowed down, and this phrase is followed by a pause of non-quantized length. After this bridge, we break into an instrumental section with a guitar solo by Brian May."

                "We have multiple choruses plus an instrumental one, so this is the central section of the song. The phrasing is not square and the first phrase uses a clich\u00e9 progression. The Gm7 chord/harmony superimposes B\u266d, Gm7, F, and probably several other chords. The upbeat of the section (\u201cit\u2019s so\u201d) features flat 6 and flat 7 degrees foreshadowing the end and the bass line is very jumpy. The second chorus has different lyrics for the first three measures. In the fourth chorus, the lyrics are in their second variant. Some lead guitar fills are added, and the seventh measure has a pattern of 1/16ths. Freddie Mercury\u2019s vocals close on a seventh, slowly resolving upwards. The outro choruses follow in the same vein, with more lead guitar fills, as the song slowly fades out."

                "The verse is unusually short only four measures and it is followed by a chorus. The tonality of the verse is not very strong. The B\u266d chord is motivated by a chromatic descent (C B A# A G#). Note the unusual maj7 leap in the lead vocal in the second measure. The bass enters in measure four, drums enter on the downbeat of the chorus (except a short roll on the downbeat of the third measure). The lead vocal of the second phrase parallels the first. The first phrase is closed with an exotic maj7th leap in the lead vocal. In the second verse, drums and bass play all the way; the bass imitates the lead vocal, and the last words are harmonized."

                "The first note is G (dominant) followed by several descending synth glissandos and reverses cymbals. Toward the end of the intro, the glissando gets continuous, and the noises get more intense, and just before the glissando reaches G again, Freddie Mercury enters on the piano."
