                "This six-measure section is reminiscent of the instrumental sections from earlier due to the prolonged B5 chord slide down each time. These chords sound like ii in the context of the preceding weakly established A Major key. Speedy drum figures introduce the speedy guitar solo from Brian May. The guitar solo is ten measures long, Roger Taylor plays constant 1/16 beats on the hi-hat and Freddie Mercury adds some Mercury-esque semi-spoken vocals. May\u2019s solo is played mostly in 1/16 tempo in mixed mode (dominated by minor pentatonic mode), and he uses upward scales and alternate pedal points combined with rhythmic emphasis. The solo closes with an over one octave ranged chromatic run downwards arriving on E. We then break into the pre-chorus."

                "We have two very similar choruses that are each fourteen measures long. The tempo is doubled compared to the verses, and also the drums are getting much more active. The chord progression is short through with non-diatonic chords part of which (\u266dII, \u266dV) can\u2019t be considered to be borrowed from any neighbor key. The \u266dIII-\u266dII-I might be treated as a Phrygian cadence, but the melody sounds modally mixed. The acyclic lead melody rides on this ambiguous harmony so naturally and appealingly as if it would be the most common chord progression. Note the triadic figures in the tune of the first phrase, which make the tune difficult to sing without chordal backing. The home key is not established by strong cadences, but the preceding chords (C#m, D, Bm) reinforce it to some extent. The key modulates to ii (\u266d minor) for the last phrase. Rhythmically, all the phrases start on the downbeat, with melodic triplets. The last phrase has powerfully arranged harmonized vocals. The last chorus adds lead guitar that mimics the lead vocal in a rubato style most of the time, but not everywhere. This last chorus ends the song with the final word looped."

                "This instrumental break is two measures shorter than the first.  This break has falsetto \u201cooooh\u201d vocals, and the synth plays B minor chords spiced with chromatic double appoggiaturas creating that exotic Bm-Gm/B alternating chord progression. This particular appoggiatura is rarely used by Queen. The tonality is still weak, the prolonged chords (C in the previous section, C#m in the following section) can\u2019t establish any home key properly. Here the prolonged B5 (Bm) chord together with the pitch set makes one\u2019s ear interpret B minor as the actual tonic, where the vi chord (in context of a minor key) is enabled by the melodic minor scale with raised seventh. The drums repeat a simple asymmetric pattern throughout."

                "Verse 1\nThis first verse is five measures long but could be considered six, where the last measure is overlapped with the beginning of the second instrumental bridge. The drumming is more complex than the second verse. There are some double-tracked vocals in this verse as well.\n\nVerse 2\nThe second verse is six measures long and also 1-2 chords are added to break the droning of the slow harmonic rhythm. The prolonged C#5 (C#m) chord and the pitch set suggest C# minor to be the tonic of this section. Note the frequently used melodic appoggiatura. The melodic phrases start varyingly past-/pre-/on downbeat. The drums play quarters on low toms then switch to the instrumental bridge. The rhythm guitars are also altered for the second verse and a brief guitar harmony (C#m7) is added, and besides some percussive guitar notes, Brian May also adds a helicopter-like sound on the guitar. Some additional shouts from Freddie Mercury are heard in this verse as well."

                "After the acapella vocal intro, we hear a short instrumental bridge that is six measures long and it is characterized by a thickening arrangement by Brian May: Bent guitar figure during first two measures, two-part guitar harmony for the rest of the section, descending slow chromatic scale (from Maj7 down to Maj3 in context of B) in the last two measures plus another guitar descending roughly parallel with it for only the last few notes. The chromatic scale fragment closed with a single whole step arrives on the root of the next chord. A close variant of the guitar work of this section also appears in \u201cGimme The Prize\u201d. We then hear the first verse."

                "The intro starts with an acapella three-four part harmony in the first phrase, with Freddie Mercury in solo during the last three measures. Rhythm guitars enter with the drums entering on the fourth beat. The synths come in as well and the drums are sparely played until the chorus.\n\nPart 1\nThe intro is eleven measures long with a square eight-measure core that has an A-B-A-B form chordwise and the melodic phrasing is A-B-A-B. Despite the parallel A-B couplets, one tends to parse the phrases as A-B-A-B' due to the harmony/solo vocals and the \u201cre-Intro\u201d section that skips the last B' phrase. The two A phrases in spite of nearly identical harmonies, sound remarkably different due to different mixing. The B melodic phrases are different at their first measures, moreover, the second one prolongs the last chord for an extra three measures and adds three-part stepwise descending harmonies on the synth. That figure is in fact four measures long, but it\u2019s overlapped by the B' phrase, and becomes a part of it. The tonality is very weak and none of the chords sounds like a strong tonic. The melodic phrases start on the downbeat, and we have a pre-downbeat accent on \u201c\u2026universe\u201d.\n\nPart 2\nWe move to the chord G. The last synth figure challenges one\u2019s sense of rhythm partly due to it puts emphasis on the last two 1/16 beats of each quarter beats. The lack of drum beats and the pre-downbeat placement of the \u201cPower\u201d syllable is disorienting. After this stunning vocal intro, we have a short instrumental."
