                "The fourteen measure pre-chorus can be parsed into seven two-measure phrases some of them with A-A sub-phrasing. The first phrase is a shifted-up melodic variant of the first phrase of the verse, while the last phrase is identical with the last two measures of the verse. The dramatic arch is rising until the climactic fourth and fifth phrase with double-tracked vocals, the settle down last phrase provides dynamic space for the bombastic chorus.\n\n\n\nIn the first phrases, the lead melody moves around (mostly above) the 1st degree (F). Note the melodic \u266d3 note, the only non-diatonic note in the vocal parts. The phrases are an added step-wise ascending three-note motif. The ascending bassline creates some inverted chords. The second pre-chorus adds some synths and the third pre-chorus is for the bottleneck slide guitar solo. It is very economic in its melodicism."

The first three phrases have an A-A sub-phrasing. A treble F note is present throughout the section but not really pedal-like. The roughly arch-shaped lead melody roughly parallels the root progression a fifth above with only three chords used."

The next three subphrases feature half-measure long octave synth arpeggios that build up in length. The second and third subsection of the Intro introduces the harmonic background of the verse. It also introduces the playful bassline, the signature machine-talk hook-tag which will close the second verse and each of the three pre-choruses."
