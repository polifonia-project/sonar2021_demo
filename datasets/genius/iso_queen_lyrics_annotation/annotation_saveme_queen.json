                "While Brian wrote this about a friend, it is unclear who. Many people have theorized it to be about Freddie given the status of his relationship at the time. If it was, this goes with the believe narrative of \u201cDon\u2019t Try Suicide\u201d, however Freddie always performs with passion and would even start fights before performances sometimes to better perform his emotions."

                "The chorus is the loudest section of the song, and the phrasing is square except the second chorus which ends on a deceptive cadence prolonged for an extra beat longer. All phrases start on the tonic chord, and the first and last also close on that. The often step-wise (both diatonic and chromatic) descending bassline creates many inverted chords. The I-V6/4-I7  cadence is familiar from \u201cTeo Torriate (Let Us Cling Together)\u201d. The last phrase ends with the modally inflected double plagal cadence. These chords create a smooth transition to the verses (in G Major), where these three chords (C, G, D) will be the basic chords. The arrangement adds electric guitars along the strummed acoustic guitars, the piano (buried in the mix) cannot be heard. The second half has simple vocal harmonies.\n\n\n\nThe second verse has more vocal harmonies (still simple), and also background guitar harmonies. The modified ending adds acoustic guitars introducing the interlude, and also guitar feedback noises (B) can be heard, which is sustained further in the next section. The third chorus is reserved for the guitar solo by Brian May. It drops the lead vocal but keeps the backing vocals. The solo lasts until the last phrase, where the lead vocal returns (overlapped with the lead guitar). The solo is very passionately performed. This last chorus closes on the subdominant chord providing tension to resolve for a tag-like repetition of the last two phrases. After these two phrases, Freddie Mercury\u2019s piano closes the song."

                "Similar to the verses, the pre-choruses are eight-measure long and have square phrasing. The third phrase is musically more or less identical to those of the verse. The arrangement is joined by double-tracked acoustic guitars and bass guitar. Despite the imported third phrase this time it\u2019s easier to stay in 4/4 instead of using 7/8 and 9/8 measures because the \u201cTil I die\u201d syllable falls on a strong 4/4 beat. Compared to the first pre-chorus, the second one adds drums and piano overdubs and simple vocal harmonies but drops the acoustic guitar arpeggios. The third pre-chorus is represented by only its second half. The acoustic guitars are back, but there are no vocal harmonies."

                "The song starts without an intro but with a 1/8 upbeat. All the phrases start with an upbeat. The second phrase parallels the first a fourth higher both melodically and chord-wise. Compared to the loud chorus, the first verse is seemingly low mixed, partly because it\u2019s accompanied only by piano and Freddie Mercury sings with a relatively soft voice here. The second verse has a richer ensemble: Drums, bass, acoustic and electric guitars, and the piano is buried and hardly audible. In the last two phrases of the verses in the catchy and natural lead melody, there is a disorienting rhythm caused by the main accents being displaced."
