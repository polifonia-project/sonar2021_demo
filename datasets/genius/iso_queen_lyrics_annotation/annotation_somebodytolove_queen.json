                "This outro contains three distinct sections: The gospel section, the coda, and the piano outro.\n\nGospel section\nThis first section uses the concept of repeating a melodic phrase with the always-thickening arrangement. First, we have the main tune for the bass voices (Brian May, Freddie Mercury). Then we add octave harmonies and also drums with slow gradual crescendo throughout the section. Then the fifth and thirds enter with soprano octaves (Roger Taylor, John Deacon) added. Then, the soprano thirds come in with different punctuation, also handclaps and bass fade in. Then finally, the phrase extends with an oscillating last syllable and the extra high note on  \u201c\u2026love\u201d. The next phrase is a variant of the opening phrase of the song (or vice versa), with Freddie\u2019s voice soloed. The last syllable is an 11-note pentatonic melisma. When then hear the coda.\n\nCoda\nThe coda sings the same eight-measure phrase seven times with Mercury singing along with semi-improvised vocals. The chord progression is mainly the same, only the harmonic rhythm is faster for the last two chords. The vocal harmony is tightly arranged.\n\nPiano Outro\nThe short outro is an extension of the ending phrase of the coda. It starts with a slow down, then Freddie plays on the piano some trills and ad-lib figures. The song closes with a staccato chord on the tonic."

                "The song starts with an almost acapella intro with soft piano backing that has five phrases of irregular length. All multitracked by the band (Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon), both the first and last phrase have merely one syllable each. A variant of this section will be shown up toward the end of the gospel section, which is also a variant of the end chorus. The second part of the intro is played on the piano with the drums and bass entering on the upbeat. While the piano line instantly establishes the \u00be meter, we have a chain of disorienting hemiolas. We then break into the first verse."

In this line, Mercury is stating that people have been telling him something\u2019s wrong with him in his desperate search for love, as the line before this makes clear\u2014 \u201cThey say I\u2019m goin' crazy!\u201d"

                "Throughout this song, the refrain \u201cCan anybody find me somebody to love?\u201d is used with a dual meaning. The obvious meaning is that he\u2019s asking anybody in the world to find him a person he can love. The second meaning is a result of his insecurity at failing to find love. He\u2019s wondering if there\u2019s anybody in the world that would find him deserving of their love.\nAlso worth mentioning that this line has bisexual context, since it relates perfectly with the hardships on finding love with homophobia around."

                "An entire turnaround from the slightly defeatist attitude that Freddie embodies earlier in the song. He\u2019s determined to find somebody he can bond with. No longer is he whining in the mud. This is Freddie at his best: a determined man with his mind set on a single goal. That goal is love.\n\nAdditionally, although unrelated to the actual lyrics, there is a point in the song (2:50 to be precise) where there\u2019s a high sound, often mistaken for Brian May\u2019s guitar. In actual fact, this is drummer Roger Taylor\u2019s amazing falsetto in action."

Perhaps Mercury\u2019s also lost a bit of himself along the way \u2013 the phrase \u201closing [their] beat\u201d often refers to when someone gets lost with their identity."
