                "After the last bridge, the tempo speeds up, and the synth bass keeps playing a one-measure ostinato-riff throughout, as Brian May begins a guitar solo. The solo is one of his fastest soloss with the bend-tapping technique that Brian used in another song like \u201cIt\u2019s Late\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Lose Your Head\u201d. The guitar solo\u2019s end overlaps the outro."

                "This bridge is a six-measure section played twice with the same lyrics, but with altered details in the arrangement and melody/phrasing. The lead guitar plays fill that is antiphonal-like in the context of the lead vocal\u2019s one-measure subphrases. The chord progression of the first phrase foreshadows the outro chord progression. The second bridge echoes the lyrical phrases (spoken not sung). Note there\u2019s no antiphonal-like guitar fills here."

                "There are two choruses that are fourteen measures long and builds up from two-measure phrases. Similar to the verse, the first two phrases parallel each other in terms of harmonic rhythm. The chord progression makes use of borrowed chords. We have a double plagal cadence, and the I-\u266dVII-\u266dVI progression. Shape-wise, the lead melodies are identical, rhythm-wise they are different, and the different chordal backing makes them sound totally different partly because the \u266dVI chord is pivoting to the key of G\u266d Major. The lead melody is a three-part harmonized, all multitracked by Freddie Mercury, only in the first phrase, and also \u201cbacking\u201d lead guitar is added.\n\n\n\nThe guitar crescendos sound like reversed records. The next subsection is accompanied by synth chords and pizzicato-mimicking arpeggios. An extra arpeggio pattern is added for the second phrase. The harmony is ambiguous between Gb Major and its relative minor key (Eb). The last phrase starts with a vocal cluster:E\u266d-G\u266d-B\u266d-C-D\u266d. The last phrase also adds a rising lead guitar fill that is joined by a descending/concluding guitar fill."

                "This section is characterized by uneven phrasing with constant harmonic rhythms, and interesting chord progressions that were co-written by John Deacon and Freddie Mercury. The phrases parallel each other in terms of melodic shape and rhythm, and the way the last measures of each phrases abandons the vamping synth chords and adds an arpeggiator creates arch-shaped arpeggios that resonate with the word \u201cmiracle\u201d.  The phrases respectively start on higher notes to create a climactic effect for the start of the chorus. For a similar effect, the last phrase adds drums and piano, moreover, Freddie\u2019s lead vocal gets more intense. The last syllable slides down through five different notes, seven in the second verse. The harmony quickly steers to the relative Major key that is established by a strong cadence. Right then the Cm-G progression is a weak attempt to get back to C minor. The chord progression of the last phrase has chords all borrowed from the parallel minor key (E\u266d minor)."

                "The intro is a two-measure long section that exposes the tonic chord on the synth that mimics pizzicato strings and nicely resonates with the \u201craindrops\u201d in the lyrics soon in the verse. The four-in-the-bar vamping is peppered with occasionally dotted rhythms and double appoggiaturas. The first downbeat is preceded by a slash on the open hi-hat, it is repeated one measure later, and that\u2019s all that the drums play until the last phrase of the verse."
