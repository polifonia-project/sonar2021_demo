                "The chorus is 15 measures long, but the phrasing is square until the closing A-A-A-B phrasing. Harmony vocals are added in parallel thirds. The only curious thing in the chord progression is the third phrase with the chromatic \u266dVII progression, some inverted chords (both second and first inversion), and the counterpart like bassline in the third phrase. This section has the quickest harmonic rhythm. The lead phrases start on downbeats and are dominated by descending figures. The rhythm department is dominated by asymmetric accents except for the last phrase. The last chorus adds more lead guitar fills. The last chord is prolonged for four measures then it resolves back to the tonic (plagal cadence) where the conga figure enters again and starts the outro. While the guitar plays a last jazzy figure and Freddie Mercury whispers his legendary goodbye (\u201cI still love you\u201d) the synth fades out then slowly the congas too."

                "There are two verses that are 18 measures long. The harmonic phrase-form is A-A-B, and the melodic phrase-form is A-B-C. Omitting some passing chords, the harmonic rhythm is constant throughout. Note the chain of fourths in the last phrase. The passing chords and parallel sixths in the accompaniment often use rhythmic patterns foreshadowing the chorus. The melodic phrases start shortly after the downbeats. The arrangement adds some interesting percussions. Note the off-beat guitar scale in the first verse, and three descending scales in the second verse."

                "After the second chorus, we break into a guitar solo from Brian May. The solo is very melodic and beautiful. The harmony makes contrasts with the rest of the song by not using the tonic chord. The A minor to E minor to B\u266d to A minor progression is also a variant of the \u201cchromatic \u266dVII\u201d progression. The two halves of the solo are different in style. The first one is a slow \u201cmeditative\u201d tune with some non-quantized rhythms and slow bends. The second half is busier with quick runs of arpeggiated notes that are doubled with echo. We then break into the final chorus."

He wishes he could turn back time to experience these wonderful past memories he\u2019s reminiscing on, but he knows that he can\u2019t. It\u2019s a sad, but honest realization that everybody must have at some point in their life. This line is especially poignant, considering the context that Mercury would pass away from AIDS related complications only a few months after the music video for the track was recorded."

Roger wanted to make clear the past of Freddie Mercury\u2019s life before he was told that he had AIDS. He pointed out that Mercury\u2019s life was probably completely gone but his love for music was still alive. \u201cI still love you\u201d said Freddie\u2019s last goodbye to all his fans and the people who loved him."
