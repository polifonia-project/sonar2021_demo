                "These lyrics reference the bridge of \u2018My Fairy King\u2019, a song written by Mercury for Queen\u2019s self-titled album, with which they debuted 18 years earlier.\n\nSomeone, someone\nHas drained the color from my wings\nBroken my fairy circle ring\nAnd shamed the king in all his pride\nChanged the winds and wronged the tides\nOh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)\nLook what they\u2019ve done to me (Yeah)\nI cannot run, I cannot hide\n\nThis time, May has re-written Mercury not as someone who has been hurt and shamed, but as beautiful and resilient. This reassurance is especially poignant considering the social stigma and ostracization experienced by many people living with HIV/AIDS."

            [
                "A pantomime is a type of musical theatre developed in England. Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture, developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy and other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century masques and music hall. An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the harlequinade. This theatrical genre created many characters like the Harlequin and the Pierrot.\n\n\n\n\n\nA popular depiction of a Harlequin\n\n\n\nOutside Britain, the word \u201cpantomime\u201d is often understood to mean miming, the act of telling a story through movement and facial expression, Marcel Marceau being the most famous."

                "The intro chord progression keeps repeated during the choruses. The drums play a steady beat, and we also have rhythm guitars. The lead vocal starts one octave higher than the closing note of the verse. The first two melodic phrases are descending, short and close variants. The third melodic phrase is longer, and after a long step-wise oscillation it descends (first chorus). The key is shifted up by a whole step for the second verse and this change is assisted by a nice guitar fill. The second chorus has harmonized title phrases and backing vocal blocks in the last phrase. The last melodic phrase is extended to overlap the instrumental section.\n\n\n\nThe chorus after the bridge uses a similar echo motif we heard in the second verse, and what will close the song. The last melodic phrase is altered to drive the song to climactic heights. Guitar harmonies introduce the last chorus and the first half of the last chorus is a guitar solo by Brian May which has similar ascending runs to the first guitar solo. The lead vocal returns for the second half of the section, with the ending extended. The lead tune is carried by cascaded harmonies, and the lead vocal returns only for the last word (\u201cshow\u201d) with a appoggiatura in E minor. The outro consists of a repeated cascaded repetition of the title phrase, with a slow fade-out."

                "Verse 1\nThe chord progression is the same as in the Intro, so let us concentrate on the lead vocal and the arrangement. The lead tune of the first two phrases start identically, but while the ending of the first phrase is descending, in the second phrase the lead melody ascends, and the rest of the section closes the arch-shape. We have a nice melodic bassline with lots of treble figures. Note the spare use of guitar glissandos, and antiphonal countermelodies with the percussive use of drums in the beginning.\n\nVerse 2\nThe second verse is in C# minor. Roger Taylor plays the beat, and Brian May continuously plays countermelodies for Freddie Mercury. The only major variation of the lead vocal is the ascending ornament that closes the section. The second half of this verse adds echo-like antiphonal vocals in two blocks where the second has doubled frequency. This verse also adds an extra measure to modulate back to B minor."

                "Following the second chorus, we break into a short bridge in A minor. The bridge uses Bach-like dissonances, especially the stark return to B minor. The bridge is completed with drum rolls and arpeggiated guitar licks, with Freddie Mercury belting out high notes before exploding back into the fourth chorus."

                "Even though Freddie Mercury is singing this, it\u2019s possible that this line could be from the perspective of Brian May and the rest of the band, for even if they lose Mercury, they have to find the will to carry on and honor his memory the best they could.\n\nAnd carry on they did, for the remaining active members continue to perform to this day, this time collaborating with another singer in 2011 onwards: Adam Lambert.\n\nThis line could also be May putting himself in Mercury\u2019s shoes and seeing things from his perspective. Freddie could have easily given up on music, as his body was deteriorating rapidly due to his illness. Despite the odds against him, he found passion for life and work that pushed him to carry on, no matter how hard things eventually became.\nBrian, who wrote the track, has spoken numerous times of his admiration for Freddie\u2019s undeniable strength and bravery through it all."

Only John Deacon decided to call it quits, playing with his bandmates only a few times before retiring from the music business."

                "Guitarist Brian May stated that once Freddie told the rest of the band of his AIDS diagnosis, he refused to bring it up ever again. On top of this, he asked that they not be sad or make a fuss of the matter while working together in the studio. For this reason, Brian wrote this song from Freddie\u2019s perspective, in order to give him a way to work through his emotions without having to speak of them out loud, something he was obviously battling with.\nThat feeling of restlessness and frustration, the idea that your time is running out faster than everyone else, despite having so much left you need and want to do, is a feeling not easily faced nor described.  So, naturally, being a songwriter, May attempted to describe that sort of head-space with this heartbreaking line."

He soon found out that he had AIDS around 1987. In the lyrics of this songs he left some of the last words for the other members of the band and the fans around the world, by saying that even though his life was going to end soon and his physical appearance was changing his recognition for everything they have done for him and his love for his fans will always stay in the line and that everything should continue after his death."
