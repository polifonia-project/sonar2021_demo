                "Chorus 1 \u2013 0:34 \u2013 1:12\n\nChorus 2 \u2013 1:50 \u2013 2:24\n\nChorus 3 \u2013 2:22 \u2013 2:52\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s three non-repetitive choruses in the song which is remarkably few in context of rock anthems. Compared to the verses, the melodic phrases are shifted to the right with more of them starting on the downbeat. The harmony of the first phrase is driven by diatonic chains of fifths, especially if we substitute B\u266d with its \u201cstand-in\u201d pair G minor. The last phrase is driven by a stepwise ascending line and a static F note in the bassline and various dissonances. Note the chromatic cross-relation: A in the melody, B\u266d in the chordal backing.\n\n The harmony shifts toward the parallel minor key that establishes only after the chorus. Between the last two choruses the tonic of F minor does not appear. The rhythm figure of the last chord nicely resonates with the piano double-accents in the verse and the following instrumental bridge. The second and third chorus adds lead guitar fills, and the last chorus alters the backing rhythm. The song ends with a fermata unresolved on the C7sus4 chord."

                "Verse 1 \u2013 0:00 \u2013 0:33\n\nVerse 2 \u2013 1:17 \u2013 1:49\n\n\n\nThere are two verses in this song, that are both slightly different. Here\u2019s my analysis of each verse:\n\nVerse 1\nThe first verse starts with Freddie Mercury on the piano with bass accompaniment. Note the piano accents fall on the 1st and 2nd 1/6 beats in the first and sixth two-measure subphrase while they fall on the 2nd and 3rd beats in the intervening subphrases. This is rhythmically disorienting and may cause 7/8 measures when played not carefully enough. Then re-enters the bass and double-tracked guitars come in, playing antiphonal fills. The bass sustains E\u266d as guitar arpeggio\u2019s play E\u266dsus4 where the piano plays A\u266d. The music changes to fortissimo, as Roger Taylor enters with the drums and Brian May plays guitar chords with overdriven tone. The last phrase steers the harmony toward F major (the key of the chorus) through B\u266d Major. The choir harmonies of the last phrase have a unison upbeat.\n\nVerse 2\nThe second verse is slightly different then the first. This verse has similar appoggiatura driven static harmonic backing as in the first. The drums are played throughout the section, with hi-hat and cymbal work. Brian\u2019s two track guitar fills underscore perfectly the mood of the section as John Deacon plays melodic treble figures. For the second phrase the bassline gets lower, Roger changes to cymbals and Brian plays the arpeggios familiar from the first verse, but this time with some hocket-like touches added. We then break into the choruses."

                "\u201cI was thinking about football when I wrote it,\u201d Freddie Mercury told Circus in 1978, when asked about \u201cWe Are the Champions.\u201d \u201cI wanted a participation song, something that the fans could latch on to. Of course, I\u2019ve given it more theatrical subtlety than an ordinary football chant.\u201d But for all the inherent grandiosity of Queen\u2019s music and live performances, the rest of the band were taken aback when Freddie first presented them with the song, initially believing that its message was unbecomingly arrogant, even for them. \u201cOur initial sense of it was that it was something very big headed,\u201d May told Guitar World in 2008. \u201cWe all looked at Fred and said, \u2018Really?\u2019 But he had a very clear view of it. It was aimed at an audience that wanted to feel a togetherness and a power and an optimism. He knew people would sing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d has become an anthem for victories at sporting events, including as an official theme song for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and has been often used or referenced in popular culture."

                "A very abrupt ending to the song, as it feels like the next line should be \u201cof the world\u201d, but it never comes.\n\nNaturally, people believe that this ending is an example of the popular Mandela Effect, a phenomenon where people remember events differently from how they really happened, or even events that had never happened to begin with.\n\nSome likely explanations for the collective belief that the song ended with the lines \u201cof the world\u201d is that Mercury may have performed some live shows where he added the line, or that people are just remembering the iconic line in the middle of the song instead.\n\nRegardless, the line is not in any studio recordings of the song, although a majority of clips, including the ones from Big Bang Theory or The Mighty Ducks, use the lyrics in the first chorus and cut the lyrics off there.\n\nBelow: A live performance where Freddie Mercury ends on \u201cof the world.\u201d\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKlrRwJB8A"

                "At this point, Freddie Mercury proclaims his greatest ambitions \u2013 fame, wealth, and success. This is such a humongous challenge, because getting \u2013 worldwide \u2013 fame is harder to attain more than anything else. Mercury \u201cwon\u201d his fame in 1974 and later on, but \u201clost\u201d to himself in 1991, of AIDS. And his family lost him.\n\nBut what he really wanted to do was far different from the British rock band Queen itself.\n\nAccording to a 2011 The Telegraph interview with Mercury\u2019s family, at the height of his fame, Mercury wanted nothing more than to sit in the kitchen as his mother cooked for him. His mother said, \u201cHe (Freddie Mercury) wanted to be as normal as possible.\u201d Of course, he  missed his family \u2013 a lot. So, during his world tours, he \u201cwould send postcards from around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nNote the humanist sentiment \u201cbefore the whole human race\u201d, rather than \u201cbefore God\u201d, as the ultimate judge of achievement."
