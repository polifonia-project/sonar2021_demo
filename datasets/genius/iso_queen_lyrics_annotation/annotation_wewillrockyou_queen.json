The vocals are in unison and the octave harmonies are overdubbed many times for creating a mass-chant effect. The pitch set of the lead vocal is added in the 2nd degree."

                "Verse 1 \u2013 0:13 \u2013 0:24\n\n\n\nThe eight-measure verse doesn\u2019t have much to analyze. The start of the second lyrical phrase (\u201cplaying\u2026\u201d) falls on the third beat of the second measure and the pitch-set is pentatonic. The closing of the section descends an octave below the starting notes."

                "1:33 \u2013 2:02\n\n\n\nA long, fading-in, feedback E note introduces Brian May\u2019s famous guitar solo outro, which is the only time a melodic instrument is played in the song.  In most performances, this song transitioned into \u201cWe are the Champions.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe solo itself is built around the A and D/A chords, with lots of double and triple-stops. There\u2019s pedal bass on the open A string, with hardly any single-note passages during the solo. The solo ends with a thrice-played phrase reminiscent of the triple-tag ending heard on \u201cSeaside Rendezvous\u201d. On the album cut of the song, this phrase was repeated by means of a tape loop, rather than being played by May that way, according to an interview May gave to NPR\u2019s Terry Gross:\n\n\u2026You may notice that the last piece, the very last little riffs, are repeated, and they\u2019re not just repeated by me playing them again. They\u2019re repeated by cutting the tape and splicing it on again and again\u2026\""

                "One interpretation of the song is that it\u2019s about how society looks down on people and tries to control them throughout their lives. The verses show how society berates the main character and calls him a disgrace, first as a boy, then as a young man, and finally as an old man. \u201cWe will rock you\u201d could be interpreted as saying society will dominate you, try to keep you from achieving your dreams, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that this song and We Are the Champions were released as opposite sides of the same single. We Are the Champions could also be seen as the \u201copposite side of the coin\u201d metaphorically; in contrast, it\u2019s an empowering song about affirming yourself and achieving your dreams despite the obstacles."

The character in this song is definitely in for some trouble later on in life, so this could be foreshadowing to that."
