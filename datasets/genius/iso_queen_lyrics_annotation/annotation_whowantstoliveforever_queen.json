                "The instrumental outro can be divided into three subsections, the first of which is characterized by a chain of minor chords with leaps of descending thirds creating an ambiguous dramatic tonality. This type of chord progression is frequently used in film scores for thrillers and dramatic parts. The second subsection starts with a minimalistic slow guitar solo with some nice countermelodies. It is followed by a harmony progression combining pedal point and descending parallel thirds. The whole harmony is enveloped by the E minor tonic chord. The last subsection starts with an ascending synth organ arpeggio similar to the intro and is resolved by a string chord. The song closes on a menacing D chord."

                "After the post-chorus, we have a slow yet powerful guitar solo from Brian May. The melodic phrasing is A-A-B-C, while the harmonic phrasing is in A-A-A-A form. The slow-paced guitar solo has lots of fingerpicked notes and is one of Brian\u2019s more simple but also most dramatic works. The solo is played in E minor."

                "The first chorus, sung by Brian May, has three phrases, the first two of which are paralleling each other. The second chorus, now sung by Freddie Mercury, is altered from the third phrase which is followed by an instrumental first phrase, followed by a vocal phrase extended with a climactic ending, reflected in the high notes. The third chorus takes from the verse the C# half diminished chord, with the ending chord being B\u266d/D. There are added vocal harmonies and the last chord is slightly changed (Gm7), which is prolonged twice as long and added with a final phrase."

                "The eight-measure verse, sung by Brian May, starts with an upbeat and the harmony is full with inverted chords. The approach of the half-diminished chord is reminiscent to \u201cSpread Your Wings\u201d. The tonality is ambiguous with hints for both E minor and A minor. The shape of the tune shows two arches. The second verse, now sung by Freddie Mercury, has different orchestration, and also added a double kick on the bass drum."

                "Both the Highlander films and the relevant television series depict human immortals who ended up outliving their loved ones, their families, and the culture which spawned them. The franchise has an emphasis on the dramatic aspects of watching everything around you die.\n\nBrian May was inspired by one pivotal scene of Highlander, which the song ended up scoring: Connor McLeod sees his wife Heather grow old and die, something he is unable to experience as an Immortal. This shows how living forever can be a really saddening experience, especially as Immortals cannot have children and have someone to remember their loved ones by.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7xQz_e90Ws"
