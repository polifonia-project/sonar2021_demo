 "lyrics": "My heart is sad and lonely\nFor you I sigh, for you dear only\nWhy haven't you seen it\nI'm all for you body and soul\n\nI spend my days in longing\nAnd wondering why it's me you're wronging\nI tell you I mean it\nI'm all for you body and soul\n\nI can't believe it\nIt's hard to conceive it\nThat you'd turn away romance\nAre you pretending\nIt looks like the ending\nUnless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear\n\nMy life a wreck you're making\nYou know I'm yours for just the taking\nI'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul\n\nMy life a wreck you're making\nYou know I'm yours for the very taking\nI'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
