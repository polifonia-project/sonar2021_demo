 "lyrics": "I'm not much to look at\nNothing to see\nJust glad I'm living\nAnd lucky to be\nI've got a man crazy for me\nHe's funny that way\n\nI can't save a dollar\nAin't worth a cent\nHe doesn't hollar\nHe'd live in a tent\nI've got that man crazy for me\nHe's funny that way\n\nThough he loves to work\nAnd slave for me everyday\nHe'd be so much better off\nIf I went away\nBut why should I leave him\nWhy should I go\nHe'd be unhappy without me I know\nI've got that man mad about me\nHe's funny that way\n\nNever had nothing\nNo one to care\nThat's why I seem to have\nMore than my share\nI've got a man crazy for me\nHe's funny that way\nWhen I hurt his feelings\nOnce in a while\nHis only answer is one little smile\nI've got a man crazy for me\nHe's funny that way\n\nI can see no other way\nAnd no better plan\nEnd it all and let him go\nTo some better gal\nBut I'm only human\nA coward at best\nI'm more than certain\nHe'd follow me West\nI've got a man crazy for me\nHe's funny that way1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
