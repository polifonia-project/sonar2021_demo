 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime\nI was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime\nNow since you got plenty money, you have thrown two good gals down\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce ain't for always and two ain't for twice\nOnce ain't for always and two ain't for twice\nWhen you get a good gal, you'd better treat her nice\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen you were lonesome, I treated you kind\nWhen you were lonesome, I treated you kind\nBut since you've got money, it has changed your mind\n\n[Verse 4]\nI'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye\nI'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye\nBut I'll write you a letter and tell you the reason why\n\n[Verse 5]\nDays are lonesome, nights are so long\nDays are lonesome, nights are so long\nI'm a good gal, but I just been treated wrongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
