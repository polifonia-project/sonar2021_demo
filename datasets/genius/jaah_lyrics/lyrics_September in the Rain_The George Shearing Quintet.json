 "lyrics": "The leaves of brown\nCame tumblin' down, remember\nIn September, in the rain\n\nThe sun went out\nJust like a dying ember\nThat September in the rain\n\nTo every word of love\nI heard you whisper\nThe raindrops seemed to play\nA sweet refrain\n\nThough spring is here\nTo me it's still September\nOoh, that September in the rain\n\nTo every word of love\nI heard you whisper\nThe raindrops seemed to play\nA sweet refrain\n\nThough spring is here\nTo me it's still September\nThat September in the rain\nI said, that September in the rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
