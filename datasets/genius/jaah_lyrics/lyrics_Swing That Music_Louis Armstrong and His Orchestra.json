 "lyrics": "(Full version.)\n\nMy heart gives a chil\nI feel such a thrill\nMy feet won't keep still\nWhen they swing that music\nRythm like that puts me in a trance\nOh you can't blame me for wanting to dance\nFrom what I understand\nIt must be just grand\nTo play in a band\nWhen they swing that music\nOh I'm as happy as can be\nWhen they swing that music for me\n\nWith my eyes I can see\nAll of the glee\nThe bees in the knees\nWhen they swing that music\nRythm like that don't do nothing but make me smile\nOh you can't blame me if I'm gone for a while\nFrom what has been said\nI'm getting ahead\nI'll swing you to bed\nOnce they've swung that music\nOh I'm as happy as can be\nWhen you swing that music with me\nMy head feels a buzz\nA reason there was\nI feel buzz because\nThey're swinging that music\nRythm like that sends me up the wall\nOh you can't blame me if I don't wanna fall\nFrom what I have heard\nIt must mean the world\nTo dance with that girl\nWhen they swing that music\nOh I'm happy as can be\nWhen you swing that music with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
