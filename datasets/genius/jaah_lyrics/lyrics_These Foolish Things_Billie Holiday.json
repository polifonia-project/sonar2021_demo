 "lyrics": "A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces\nAn airline ticket to romantic places\nStill my heart has wings\nThese foolish things remind me of you\nA tinkling piano in the next apartment\nThose stumblin' words\nThat told you what my heart meant\nA fair ground painted swings\nThese foolish things remind me of you\n\nYou came, you saw, you conquered me\nWhen you did that to me\nI knew somehow this had to be\nThe winds of march that made my heart a dancer\nA telephone that rings but who's to answer\nOh, how the ghost of you clings\nThese foolish things remind me of you\n\nHow strange\nHow sweet\nTo find you still\nThese things are dear to me\nThey seem to bring you near to me\nThe scent of smouldering leaves the wail of steamers\nTwo lovers on the street who walk like dreamers\nOh how the ghost of you clings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
