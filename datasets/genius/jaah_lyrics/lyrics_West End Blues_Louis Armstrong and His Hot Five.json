He drags a brush through his\nfinger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark\nof imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.\nANCHOR (O.S.)\nOutrage over an \u201cAfrican American\nThemed\u201d party organized by\npredominately white students of\nManchester University has resulted\nin rioting and property damages.\n2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue 2A\neyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.\nANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT\u2019D)\nGuests were invited to \u201cliberate\ntheir inner Negro, fry up chicken,\nenjoy a sugar water concoction\nknown as Purple drank and wear\noversized Barack Obama T-shirts.\u201d\n2B COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts 2B\nadjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the\nsmall TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips. *\nANCHOR (CONT\u2019D)\nOfficials claim an investigation is\nunderway to find those responsible\nfor the event and subsequent riot.\n2C SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an 2C\nedit bay.

That and more after the break.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHow could this happen?\nTITLE CARD: FIVE WEEKS AGO\n3 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 3\nThis sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern\narchitecture is presented like a living brochure.\nSUPERIMPOSE: MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - \u201cNOSCE TE IPSUM\u201d\nAs we cut through the living brochure, we\u2019re presented with\ngroups and programs.

STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 4\nSamantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way\nwindow with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older.\nShe gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a\nsubversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan.\nSUPERIMPOSE: SAMANTHA WHITE, SENIOR, VISUAL AND NEW MEDIA\n2.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nSorry, but your weed man Tyrone\ndoes not count.\nShe fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to\naddress a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title\n\u201cEBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE.\u201d One by one she scribbles\nher autograph on the books.\n5 EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY 5\nSERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS\nDisheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE.\n5A Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A\n5B Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. His sweet but 5B\ninsecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head.\nSUPERIMPOSE: LIONEL HIGGINS, JUNIOR, PHILOSOPHY UNDECLARED\nSTUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his\nalready full hands. Lionel\u2019s a guppy. The kind that gets\neaten alive in a tank of sharks.\nAs Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he\nchecks his pockets. He\u2019s missing something. Shit.\nLIONEL\n(knocking)\nKurt! You home?\nLionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from\ninside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel\u2019s.\nANSWERING MACHINE\nHey boyssss, you\u2019ve reached Lionel\nHigginsss, the only bitch on\ncampussss who\u2019ll give you a\ndickssscount. That\u2019s right hunty,\nthe bigger the dick the less you\u2019ll\nhave to pay me to ssssuck it.\nThe beep sounds. Lionel\u2019s in shock. Should he hang up? Or...\nLIONEL\nKurt. It\u2019s Lionel. I\u2019m locked out.\nAs Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he\nunfolds the flyer he was just handed. It\u2019s a rendering of Sam\nWhite on a carton of milk with the caption:\n\u201cMISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK\u201d\n3.\n6 EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY 6\nSigns scream out \u201cORIENTATION\u201d as jazz music wafts from the\nlaptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, apparently\nMorgan Freeman in \u201cDeep Impact\u201d\nwasn\u2019t enough. Despite two terms\nObama could cure Cancer and\nsomewhere White folks will be\nembroiled in protest. And he\u2019s only\nhalf Black.\nGABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy\nhair and \u201claundry day\u201d flip flop clad ensemble, catches the\nend of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...\n7 INT.

CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11\nColandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes\nright at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She\u2019s\ngot an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.\nCOCO (YOUTUBE)\n...I am! The whole point of\nrandomized housing is to mix shit\nup. I\u2019m out here trying to find the\nOlivier to my Halle Berry, and\nthey\u2019ve got me looking like an\nextra on a Different World...\nThe video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a\n30\u2019s something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy\neverything. Too stylish for this place. If he\u2019s impressed,\nit\u2019s barely perceptible.\nHELMUT\nYou call your Youtube show \u201cDoing\nTime at an Ivy League?\u201d\nHe stares right at Coco, there in the flesh.\nCOCO\nIn my second year of a four year\nsentence. Wanted to go to New York.\nSUPERIMPOSE: COLANDREA COCO CONNERS, SOPHOMORE, ECONOMICS\nHELMUT\nYeah? And do what?\nCOCO\nThings my mama taught me not to.\nYou know get in a lot of trouble\nand become famous for it. But alas\nI didn\u2019t get into Tisch...\nHELMUT\nArmstrong / Parker? That your\nrooming assignment?\nCOCO\nTraditionally it\u2019s where the\nhopelessly Afrocentric gather to\nprocess their guilt over not going\nto an HBCU.\n(off Helmut\u2019s look)\nWhere the Negros be at.\nHELMUT\nThat\u2019s not where you want to be?\n5.\nCOCO\nBechet House is more my style.\nHELMUT\nWith the rich white kids.\nCOCO\nExcuse me?\nHELMUT\nWhat part of Chicago you from?\nCOCO\nHyde Park.\nHELMUT\nWhat street?\nCOCO\nSeventy Eighth and --\nHELMUT\n-- Seventy Eighth is Southside\nsweetheart. And you know what they\nsay. You can take the girl out the\nhood but --\nCOCO\n-- Ain\u2019t nothing hood about me.\nHELMUT\nThanks so much for coming in.\nCoco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.\nCOCO\nSo what\u2019s this show about anyway?\nHELMUT\nHere\u2019s the way reality works\nsweetheart, I\u2019m the producer. I ask\nthe questions. Be in touch.\nAnd with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders\nbefore unmuting his iPad.\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People I am here to\nburst your post-racial little\nbubble.\n6.\n(MORE)\nYes Oprah may have her own network,\nbut Ann Coulter is still writing\nbest sellers, Black kids are still\ngetting shot for wearing hoodies,\nand even here the few vestiges of\nBlack culture are under attack by\nconservative groups, trustees and\nyes our very own President\nFletcher.\nHelmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.\nHELMUT\nThis is the school radio?\n13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13\nA pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the\nhalls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively\ndebates, flirt and bump the student radio.\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, thanks to the\nnew process of randomizing housing\nassignments for Sophomores, some of\nyou may be jarred by an assignment\nto Armstrong/Parker house.\nThe owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks.\nTROY\nSomeone turn that trash off.\nSUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE\nEven with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of\nJet. Troy exudes \u201capproachable homie\u201d as he spots a small\ngroup of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nNewbies right?\nThe white sophomores nod their heads yes.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nWelcome to Armstrong / Parker, home\nof the dopest dining hall in all of\nManchester. I\u2019m Troy, Head of\nHouse.\nSOPHOMORE\nWhat\u2019s up my brother?\n7.\nSAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)\nSAM (O.S.)\nWhen encountering a Black person\ntry and stay calm. Don\u2019t say things\nlike \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d and \u201cmy brotha\u201d\nThat\u2019s not how you normally talk.\nTROY\nYa\u2019ll take care. Nice Jordan\u2019s bro.\nCoco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette\nwho exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.\nSOFIA\nYour hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.\nCOCO\nYou\u2019re so cute.\nSOFIA\nIs it weaved?\nCoco\u2019s face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.\nSOFIA (CONT\u2019D)\nI saw \u201cGood Hair\u201d in Afro studies.\nCOCO\n(moving on)\nHey what house did you get?\nSOFIA\nHuh? Oh Bechet bitch.\nCOCO\nOf course. The mere thought of a\nFletcher anywhere else...\nSOFIA\nEasy, it was the luck of the draw.\nDaddy had nothing to do with it.\nCoco rolls her eyes behind a smile.\nSOFIA (CONT\u2019D)\nAnd honestly, if I had to pick\nanywhere to be it\u2019d be here.\nSofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.\nCOCO\nI\u2019m down to switch if you are. You\nget your Denzel. I get my Gosling.\n8.\nSOFIA\nOh I got mines. Want to meet him?\nThey turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new\nSophomores. Coco\u2019s caught off guard by his looks.\nCOCO\nCute...\n(off Sofia\u2019s jealous\nglance)\n...for a Black boy.\nTroy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.\nSOFIA\nHey boo. This is my friend Coco.\nShe\u2019s new to the house.\nTROY\nHey I\u2019m Troy. Welcome to Armstrong\n/ Parker, home of the dopest --\nSOFIA\n-- Are we on duty?\nTROY\nHead of House is always on duty.\nCOCO\nNice to meet you. I should get\nsettled. Thanks Sof!\nSofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down\nthe hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy\u2019s ass.\nTROY\nThink I got time for a quick cut?\nSOFIA\nYou got it cut last week.\nTROY\nIt\u2019s a Black thing babe.\nSOFIA\nSince when is OCD a Black thang?\nTROY\nDon\u2019t say \u201cthang\u201d like that.\nSOFIA\nBesides you\u2019ve got a shift at the\nPoliticos booth, then a shift at\nOrientation, then your advisor --\n9.\nTROY\n-- I\u2019ll just wear a hat.\nSOFIA\nThen a movie maybe? Just us?\nTROY\nElection night. Babe, come on.\nSofia holds her tongue. Troy ignores this as he spots...\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nYo, Kurt my man.\n14 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14\n...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical\nknowing glare. We recognize them from the \u201cPastiche\u201d portrait\nfrom before.\nAs they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt\u2019s\nglare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.\nKURT\nSis.\nSofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of\nhis dismissal.\nThey both spot Sam\u2019s \u201cMissing: Black culture\u201d flyers.\nTROY\nIs she kidding with this?\nSOFIA\nYou don\u2019t have to run again. Just\nbecause it\u2019s her doesn\u2019t mean --\nTROY\n-- I can\u2019t let Sam and her wannabe\nBlack Panthers take the House. The\nHouse needs me. This is who I am.\nSOFIA\nIt\u2019s who he wants you to be.\nTroy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.\nTROY\nOh so you pick up a Psych class you\nthink you Freud or something? Huh?\nSOFIA\nA Freud reference. Sophisticated.\n10.\nTROY\n(seducing)\nFine Beck, Jung, Maslow...\nTroy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring\nstacks of Sam\u2019s \u201cEBONY & IVY.\u201d The booth is manned by REGGIE,\n21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both\nbohemian and radical.\nTroy glares at Sam\u2019s picture on the book. It\u2019s on. There\u2019s a\nhistory between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie\u2019s laptop we hear...\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, this just in.\nDating a Black person to piss off\nyour parents is a form of racism.\nSofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.\nREGGIE\nYo Troy I forget. Is your major in\nshucking or was it jiving?\nTROY\nMy major\u2019s in Jive. Minoring in\nShuck. You\u2019re still majoring in\ntrying to fuck my left overs right?\nTroy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.\nSOFIA\nYou need a shower.\n15 INT. TROY\u2019S BATHROOM - DAY 15\nWater runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over\nthe toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a\npaper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He\njots something down on a notepad as he whispers...\nTROY\nYou went from ODB to Trey Songz...\n16 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT 16\nThe hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black.\nHelmut West watches from the back.\nTROY\nArtie, you know your success ratio\nwith the ladies went up like thirty\npercent after I started edging you\nup dog, come on. You went from ODB\nto Trey Songz!\n11.\nThe audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone\nexcept Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro\u2019d bohemian\ndisciples (who we\u2019ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the\nproceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.\nREGGIE\nThat\u2019s his platform? Haircuts?\nSAM\nOofta is as Oofta does.\nCoco, sneaks through the door. She\u2019s got the eyes of Helmut\non her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she\nsits in the only open spot next to...\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nJust because we\u2019re colored don\u2019t\nmean we run on colored people time.\nCOCO\nBoycotting hot combs don\u2019t make you\nan expert on \u201ccolored people\u201d boo.\nCoco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.\nTROY\nNo but seriously, I care about you\nguys. I care about this house. We\nhad a great year last year and if\nit ain\u2019t broke...\nTroy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.\nSam doesn\u2019t want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.\nREGGIE\nJust pretend like you\u2019re in the\nbooth. Just you and the mic.\nSAM\nHate this shit.\nAs Sam gets up and passes Troy --\nTROY\nYou really think you can take this\nfrom me?\nSAM\nTroy we live in a world where\nthere\u2019s a Big Momma\u2019s House 3. I\ndon\u2019t have a chance in hell. Thank\nGod.\n12.\nSam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nTroy my brother, it\u2019s broke.\nThe BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nTroy\u2019s a legacy kid. And yet it\u2019s\nunder his watch that Armstrong /\nParker, the bastion of Black\nculture here was gutted. By the\nRandomization of Housing Act.\nSecond years of color no longer\nhave a say in where they go. The\nculture that\u2019s been fostered in\nthis house for two decades will be\nwiped out in two years.\nTroy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nThis wasn\u2019t motivated by a desire\nto mix things up. Bring about\nracial and socioeconomic harmony.\nNo, the Black kids are sitting\ntogether in the proverbial\ncafeteria and they must be up to no\ngood.\nCoco\u2019s eyes are in the back of her head.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nWe sit together to protect\nourselves. Over a century of houses\ngrouped by sports affiliations,\npolitical leanings, majors, you\nname it. Black folks get their own\nhouse, suddenly we got a problem?\nStudents look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam\ndelivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nThis Act doesn\u2019t affect the other\nhouses like it does ours. There are\nplenty of trustees, former coaches,\nand presidents watching out for the\nothers. All we have is a Dean who\u2019d\nrather please his massa --\nTROY\n-- Yo that\u2019s enough of that Sam --\n13.\nSAM\n-- then stand up for his own. Look,\nI know ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t voting for me.\nYa\u2019ll ain\u2019t ready and I didn\u2019t come\nhere for that. The Black Student\nUnion and I have brought a petition\nto repeal the Randomization of\nHousing Act. I plan on bringing it\nto the President and together we\ncan bring Black back to Manchester.\nIt\u2019ll be by the door.\nSam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy\n- give her daps and all sorts of praise.\nMARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with\nneat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.\nMARTIN\nI assume everyone has the app I\ncreated by now?\nREGGIE\n(aside)\nIt\u2019s a child\u2019s app...\nMARTIN\nGood. Voting may commence.\nEveryone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view\nas he punches something in.\nTroy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who\ngive him a head nod. Troy\u2019s got this. After a moment...\nMARTIN (CONT\u2019D)\nOkay. Looks like we\u2019ve got\nourselves a winner.\n(devastated)\nSam White?\nThe blood drains from Sam\u2019s face and Troy\u2019s smile plummets\ninto the floor as the two turn to look at each other.\nTROY & SAM\nOh shit.\nReggie\u2019s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and\nslips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.\n17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17\nRight on the heels of Helmut\u2019s exit is...\n14.\nCOCO\nSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for?\nHELMUT\nI\u2019m looking for good TV sister.\nCOCO\nI think I\u2019d be good TV.\nHELMUT\nYou\u2019re at a great school, getting a\ngreat education. Be good at that.\nCOCO\nI am. And when I graduate early\nwith an Economics degree from\nManchester it will be the crowning\nachievement of my Black middle\nclass parents\u2019 ambitions.\nHELMUT\nConflict is a commodity in my\nindustry. Sam\u2019s got it. Do you?\nCOCO\nSo you want me to start a fight.\nHELMUT\n(exactly)\nI don\u2019t want you to do anything you\nwouldn\u2019t otherwise do.\nHelmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.\nHe contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.\n18 INT. DEAN\u2019S OFFICE - DAY 18\nA fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while\nthe message plays over speaker phone.\nSPEAKER\n...bigger the dick the less you\u2019ll\nhave to pay me to ssssuck it.\nDean Fairbank\u2019s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMost everything\u2019s locked up, but\nwe\u2019ll find another residence to\nmove you to. Third time\u2019s a charm.\n(off Lionel\u2019s sigh)\nWhat about Armstrong / Parker?\n15.\nLIONEL\nI don\u2019t know...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI might have an opening. Maybe it\u2019d\nbe good to be around...you know.\nLIONEL\nDean. The worst thing about high\nschool, and believe me it was a\nlong list, were the Black kids.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMaybe it\u2019s in your head. Sure,\nsometimes our folks can be\nintolerant around people like you.\nHomo --\nLIONEL\n-- I don\u2019t believe in labels.\nFairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.\nLionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank\u2019s desk: Students\nof all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy\nwith the phrase \u201cMANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG\u201d printed below.\nTroy\u2019s huge smile seems to mock him.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou like jazz Lionel? Manchester\u2019s\nlike jazz you know.\nLIONEL\nThis is a research school.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAnd jazz is tension. The interplay\nof improvised solos all creating\none song. Your problem is you\u2019ve\ngot no instrument. No major, no\naffiliations, no solo son.\nLIONEL\nI submit articles to the\nIndependent Observer.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNo one reads the Independent\nObserver, my point is are you\nplaying swing or bebop?\nLIONEL\nYou\u2019re mixing metaphors.\n16.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAre you a sax or are you a trumpet?\nLIONEL\nI hate jazz.\nFairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI\u2019ll do what I can. Not a word of\nthis in the Observer okay?\nLIONEL\nWhat\u2019s it matter? No one reads it.\n19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19\nLionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out\nto..\n...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself\namongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he\ntrades \u201cNo Homo\u2019s\u201d with the others.\nLionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud\ngay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his\nhair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.\nNot right either. Where does he fit?

Sam\nbreaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.\nSAM\nYou call me the minute there\u2019s an\nupdate. Love you too mom.\nSam hangs up. The call\u2019s really put her in a bad place.

Your uninspired humor\nmagazine?\nKURT\nWe\u2019re a lot more than a magazine\nsweetie. SNL staff is basically\nhalf Lampoon, half Pastiche.

They want out.\nKURT\nBad move.\n24.\nKurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight\nsnicker from Lionel which draws Sam\u2019s eyes right to him.\nSomething sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts\nto GEORGE: \u201cI\u2019ve got the angle. I\u2019m in.\u201d\nSAM\nYou too.\nLIONEL\nMe?\nSAM\nIs this your house?\nLionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.\nSam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady\napplause. Troy and his table look around baffled.\nBy the caution on Sam\u2019s face it seems the first time she\u2019s\never heard this sound directed at her.\nA slight envy boils in Coco.\nOne last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.\nLocked out again.\n23 INT.

Poor thing, she was\nlight skin-ded and everything.\nTROY\nYo, it wasn\u2019t like that alright?\nTroy\u2019s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy\u2019s.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nMy pops. He wanted me with\nFletcher\u2019s daughter. They\u2019ve been\nin competition ever since they went\nhere. Pops hates that Fletcher\nended up President and he got stuck\nas the Dean.\nCOCO\nSo your upbringing may have\nactually fucked you up more than\nmine? That\u2019s hot.\nTroy laughs and takes the joint back.\n58.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nThe hell is the difference between\na Dean and a President anyway?\nTROY\nApparently four hundred years of\nunreconciled oppression.\nCOCO\nHe\u2019s not going to like you running\nwith the Pastiche boys is he?\nTROY\nIf I even get tapped.\nCOCO\nYou will. And you should do it.\nThey all land somewhere big, some\nbefore they even graduate. I\u2019ve\nseen you in front of a crowd Troy.\nI bet you could be famous.\nTROY\nThat what you want? To be famous?\nCOCO\nI want people to know my name.\nTROY\nWhich one?\nCoco\u2019s phone buzzes with a message. It\u2019s Kurt.\nCOCO\n(reading)\nWe want you. Come by Ellington\ntomorrow at eight.\n(to Troy)\nAnything?\nTroy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy\u2019s\neyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nYou\u2019re going to have to stand up to\nhim sooner or later Troy.\n52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52\nTroy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation\nmarks her pretty face.\nSOFIA\nYou said you loved me.\n59.\nTROY\nI like you a lot.\nSalt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.\nSOFIA\nWhat do you do in the bathroom?\nWhen you leave the shower running?\nWas it just to get away from me?\nTroy wagers his answer and decides to confess.\nTROY\nI smoke weed and write jokes.\nPuzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia\njust turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...\n...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before\nTroy turns to enter the house.\n53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53\nLionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He\nturns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other\u2019s gaze.\nAs they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that\nthey\u2019re headed in the same direction.\n53A UPSTAIRS 53A\nLionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it\nwith a key. Troy\u2019s already at the door when he looks up and\nrealizes Lionel\u2019s just entered his apartment.\n54 INT. TROY\u2019S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54\nTROY\nThe hell are you doing?\nLIONEL & TROY\nThis is my apartment.\nTROY\nThe hell it is.\nLIONEL\nThe Dean said it was the only\nopening.\nTROY\nHead of House doesn\u2019t share.\n60.\nLIONEL\nBut you\u2019re not Head of House.\nStill stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door\nleaving Lionel alone in the living room.\n57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57\nLionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the\ndifferent cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past\nand shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.\nDREADS\nStay Black, my brother.\nLIONEL\nSure thing?\nLionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the\nentrance - suddenly chums. Troy\u2019s getting good news and\ngladly shakes Kurt\u2019s hand.\nKURT\nNeed your submission by Thursday.\nTROY\nYou got it bro.\nThe two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG\nin the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining\nhall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.\nKURT\nThe fuck?\nSam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her\nother support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.\nTROY\nYo!\nTroy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the\nhumiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.\nLionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the\nother side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam\nbriefly who shares the same smirk.\nHe realizes Sam\u2019s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind\nhim at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.\nREGGIE\nFinally made it in.\n61.\nDREADS\nBeen moved around a lot right?\nCURLS\nYou must have been terrified when\nyou saw \u201cArmstrong/Parker\u201d written\non your moving assignment.\nLIONEL\nI was just finishing up.\nREGGIE\nDo Black people scare you?\nLIONEL\n(realizing its true)\nNo.\nREGGIE\nYou\u2019re too scared to even ask\nanyone for a cut.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m growing it out.\nDREADS\nNo. I\u2019m growing it out. You\u2019re\nfostering an ecosystem.\nREGGIE\nHow come you don\u2019t come to BSU?\nLIONEL\nI listen to Mumford and Sons and\nwatch Robert Altman movies. You\nhonestly think I\u2019m Black enough for\nthe union?\nDREADS\nYo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha\nfucka goes in.\nCURLS\n(after a beat)\nWe\u2019re not all homophobes you know.\nBlack folks?\nLionel\u2019s eyes dart around. How did she know?\nDREADS\nI\u2019m bumping Frank Ocean right now.\nI don\u2019t give a fuck. Imma still eat\nat Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets\ngood as hell.\n62.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m late for class.\nREGGIE\nYou\u2019re the \u201cBlack voice\u201d of the\nBugle now. We\u2019re just trying to\ndecide if you are friend or foe.\nReggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.\nSam\u2019s on the front page with the headline \u201cWHITE STUDENTS\nTOLD TO \u2018GET OUT\u2019 BY LIONEL HIGGINS.\u201d\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nWe got to protect our girl.\nReggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over\nsomething with Martin at another table.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m not on staff. Not until I make\ngood on my assignment, I\u2019m just --\nREGGIE\n-- Assignment? What\u2019s the story?\nLIONEL\nThey want me to do a profile piece\non Black culture at Manchester.\nREGGIE\nOf which you are so clearly an\nexpert.\nShame floods Lionel\u2019s face.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nSo what\u2019s harder man? Being Black\nenough for the Black kids or the\nwhite ones?\nLIONEL\nBeing neither.\nAnother GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This\ntime it\u2019s for...\n...Gabe, who\u2019s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...\nGABE\nSam! Really Sam?\nShe just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.\n63.\n58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58\nProfessor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students\nfill in essay questions. Sam\u2019s eyes are glued to a window...\nOutside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and\nstart pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.\nSam\u2019s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch\nthe time.\n59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A\nSam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.\nFrom behind her...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nRunning late.\nSam pauses and turns to see him.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D)\nFor your little rally?\nSAM\nForget your sign Dean?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDo you honestly think this is in\nthe spirit of Armstrong / Parker\nhouse?\nSAM\nThe role of the counter culture is\nto wake up the mainstream to --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n-- I\u2019ve got furniture older than\nyou. Counter culture? Is that what\nyou think this is? That show of\nyours?\nSAM\nWhat about my show?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYour show is racist.\nSAM\nBlack people can\u2019t be racist.\nThe Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.\n64.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nPrejudice? Yes. But not racist.\nRacism describes a system of\ndisadvantage based on race. Black\npeople can\u2019t be racist since they\ndon\u2019t benefit from such a system.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDo you read the school papers?\nSAM\nIs the New York Times a school\npaper?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYour antics are making press Sam\nand press like this keeps men like\nPresident Fletcher up at night.\nSAM\nWarm milk?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHe\u2019s building a file on you.\nSAM\nIt\u2019s not my fault your son couldn\u2019t\nbeat me in an election.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI\u2019m sure it was hard growing up.\nWondering which side you fit into.\nFeeling like you have to\novercompensate perhaps?\nSAM\nIf that\u2019s true, I\u2019m not the only\none Dean.\nSam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank\u2019s last words resonate\nmore than she\u2019d like.\nGabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.\n59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B\nHuge canvas signs with the words \u201cWHITES ONLY\u201d are strewn\nabout the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.\nSam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the\nSUV.\n65.\nREGGIE\nThere you are! We supposed to start\nat noon.\nSAM\nI told you I had class.\nThere\u2019s a vibration in Sam\u2019s pocket. Her phone says \u201cMOM.\u201d\nShe cuts it off and picks up a \u201cwhite\u2019s only\u201d sign.\nREGGIE\nThose are going up on Gillespie.\nGood right?\nSam shrugs in the affirmative but it\u2019s too much. Reggie sees\na doubt in her eyes.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nYo. What\u2019s that? You\u2019re not getting\ncold feet are you?\nSAM\nNo. I mean how long do I have to\ntalk anyway?\nREGGIE\nYou\u2019re kidding right? You\u2019re sort\nof the keynote.\nSAM\nYeah but...you know I think the\nwhole Malcolm X thing is your lane\nReg. I\u2019m just not --\nREGGIE\n-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab\na bullhorn. Turn it on.\nSam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse\nand comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to\nher phone. Sam checks: \u201cIT\u2019S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME\u201d\nSam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe\nwho\u2019s just happened upon the parking lot.\nGABE\nWhat is all this?\nSAM\n(on phone)\nHey. In the middle of--\n-- Okay. Okay. Okay.\n66.\nTears well up in Sam\u2019s eyes as she shakes her head no and\nheads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.\nWhen Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted\nlook of indignation asks her what she\u2019s doing.\nREGGIE\nSam?\nSam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie\u2019s\nheart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nSam!\n60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60\nReggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam\u2019s door.\nREGGIE\nYo, what the hell Sam?\n61 INT. SAM\u2019S ROOM - DAY 61\nThe banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The\ntears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.\nGABE\nYou want me to tell them to go?\nSAM\nYou\u2019re so tough.\nGABE\nI will.\nSAM\nI want you to wait until they\u2019ve\ngone and then head home.\nGABE\nI\u2019m trying to be here for you.\nSAM\nCan you be somewhere else for me?\n61A HALLWAY 61A\nREGGIE\nSam! I know you\u2019re home.\n67.\n61B SAM\u2019S ROOM 61B\nGABE\nWhat do you see in him?\nSAM\nThe only eligible single brother on\ncampus.\nGABE\nWow. Okay.\nSAM\nI get it. Your parents owned in\nHarlem or something? You watched\n\u201cDo The Right Thing\u201d in high school\nand you want to prove to the world\nyou\u2019re down?\nGABE\nI want to be down? How long does it\ntake to get your hair like that?\nREGGIE (O.S.)\nSam. We want to talk.\nSAM\nReggie I will call you later damn!\n(to Gabe)\nYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking\nabout. Girls like me--\nGABE\n--what? Have to pick a side? I\u2019m\nsick of your tragic Mulatto\nbullshit Sam!\nSAM\nYou can\u2019t say Mulatto.\nGABE\nMulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!\nMORE BANGING\nSAM\nWindow. Go out the window.\nGABE\nI\u2019m sorry if I can\u2019t be your Nubian\nprince on my Black horse ready to\ntake you back to fucking Zamunda!\n68.\nSAM\nThat\u2019s not a real African country.\nGABE\nCan I please get some credit for a\nsolid \u201cComing to America\u201d\nreference?\nSam tries not laugh at this.\nGABE (CONT\u2019D)\nThis isn\u2019t you Sam.\nSAM\nNo? And who am I?\nGABE\nYou\u2019re this...girl...\nSAM\nPerceptive.\nGABE\nWho...likes to argue with me about\nevery fucking thing. And I hate it\nbecause we both know you\u2019re smarter\nthan me. Your favorite director is\nBergman, but you tell people its\nSpike Lee. You love bebop, but\nyou\u2019ve got a thing for Taylor\nSwift. I know because my Mac picks\nup your Mac\u2019s library.\nSAM\nAnd I was so careful...\nGABE\nYou like to use phrases from the\nthirties and wear clothes from the\nfifties and hairstyles from the\nsixties. You like to watch me when\nyou think I\u2019m sleeping. And trace\nthe outlines of my face.\nSam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.\nGABE (CONT\u2019D)\nYou\u2019re more \u201cBanksy\u201d than \u201cBarack\u201d\nbut you\u2019ve been co-opted as some\nsort of revolutionary leader or\nsomething? But really you\u2019re an\nanarchist. A beautiful writer,\nartist, filmmaker, shit starter.\nAnd beautiful, in general.\n69.\nSam\u2019s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: \u201cMom.\u201d\nSAM\nYeah? Yeah? Yeah. It\u2019s okay. Get\nsome sleep.\nSam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE\nfrom Sam as she let\u2019s go of the tension she\u2019d been holding.\nGABE\nEverything okay?\nSAM\n(happy tears)\nHis condition\u2019s stable.\nGABE\nGood. That\u2019s good Sam.\nGabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.\nSAM\nGabe!\nGabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...\nGABE\nWhat!?\n...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down\nthe heartbroken looks on her disciples\u2019 faces.\nSAM\nI\u2019m sorry.\nAnd with that she closes the door right on Reggie.\n62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62\nCoco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing\nterrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee\u2019s.\nHELMUT\nNew videos are picking up steam.\nCOCO\nTold you I was good TV.\nHELMUT\nThe show I\u2019m scouting for... It\u2019s\ncalled Black Face / White Place.\nIt\u2019s reality.

You think they want\ninteresting? Dignified stories of\ntriumph and survival?\n(off Coco\u2019s naive shrug)\nThey want the \u201cauthentic urban\nexperience\u201d which is basically\nnetwork talk for bitching and weave\nsnatching. I\u2019m telling you this\nbecause the network is looking to\ntake one of the subjects to series.\nI got one episode. One shot to find\nthat subject. So if we do this...\nCOCO\n...we do it all the way. I\u2019m\nguessing Sam turned you down.\nHELMUT\nI think so. She called me a\nBojangling Oofta, whatever that\nmeans. Everything else she said\nwould\u2019ve been bleeped on tv.\n(off Coco\u2019s laugh)\nSo look, forty thousand hits on\nYoutube is good. It\u2019s not great.\nCOCO\nI\u2019m about to get a whole lot more.\n63 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - DAY 63\nCoco sits before a video camera. The room is dim.\nKURT\nWe don\u2019t have anyone like you on\nstaff and you had a great idea. We\nbrought you here to --\nCOCO\n-- I want to MC it.

What\u2019s it going\nto be?\nCUT TO:\n66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66\nHelmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye.\nCOCO\nYou look surprised.\nHELMUT\nIt\u2019s just...\n67 INT. TROY\u2019S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67\nTroy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in\ntheir rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. They\neach look at the other in alternate intervals.\nHELMUT (V.O.)\n...not everyone is as camera ready\nas you.\n67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A\n72.\nCOCO (CONT'D)\nLionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on\nhis TV and heads to...\n67B KITCHEN 67B\n...bar divide. Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy\u2019s\nroom. He\u2019s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels\nLionel\u2019s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.\n67C TROY\u2019S ROOM 67C\nTroy types in \u201cKURT FLETCHER\u201d in the \u201cTo\u201d field and \u201cPASTICHE\nSUBMISSION\u201d in the subject field. He hits \u201csend\u201d and swallows\nthe lump in his throat.\n68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68\nTroy gingerly enters into the Dean\u2019s office. Martin and Dean\nFairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMartin, would you share with Troy\nwhat you shared with me?\nMARTIN\nThe server that processes the\nvoting results for House Elections\nhas shut down the A.P. database.\nSaw it this morning. Apparently the\nintermediary program is on a\nrefractile loop.\nTROY\nI\u2019m a Poly Sci major man.\nMARTIN\nSam currently has 445 votes. That\u2019s\n200 more than she had last week\nduring the actual election.\nTROY\nThere\u2019s not even that many\nresidents in Armstrong / Parker.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nShe cheated. Hacked the system.\n69 INT. PRESIDENT\u2019S OFFICE - DAY 69\nSam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the\nDean\u2019s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.\n73.\nSAM\nI wouldn\u2019t even begin to know how\nto do something like that.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nIs your little war really this\nimportant?\nSam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT\u2019D)\nI understand the pressure to stand\nfor something at an institution\nlike this but you\u2019re barking up the\nwrong tree okay?\n70 INT. DEAN\u2019S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70\nMARTIN\nHad to have been Reggie. Dude\u2019s in\nmy programing class. Good.

I appreciate this.\n71 INT. PRESIDENT\u2019S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71\nSam glares at Fletcher.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nYour advisor tells me you\u2019re\nhanging on by a thread in you\nmajor. Perhaps it\u2019s time to\nreprioritize.\nSAM\nYou\u2019re trying to frighten me, but I\nthink you\u2019re the one who\u2019s scared.\n74.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nAnd I think you long for the days\nwhere Blacks were hanging from\ntrees and denied actual rights.\nThen you\u2019d actually have something\nto fight against.\nA swell of emotion behind Sam\u2019s steel eyes.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT\u2019D)\nYou will be facing two hearings in\nthe coming weeks that could end in\neither Probation or Suspension. One\non the merits of your show, the\nother on your election to Head of\nHouse.\nSam is truly scared by this.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT\u2019D)\nYour responsibilities to your house\nare suspended. Your show is done\nfor. And another one of your\nillegal \u201cdemonstrations\u201d will only\nmake matters worse. This is a\ncritical time for this school.\nSAM\nYou damn right it is.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nWe don\u2019t have an intolerance\nproblem here. Except for the one\nI\u2019m looking at.\n72 INT.

She was very upset.\n(off Troy\u2019s silence)\nTroy. What sort of vision do you\nhave for yourself?\n75.\nTROY\nGet my degree. Then Law School and\nthen --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n--And what\u2019s that got to do with\npartying with Kurt? With smoking\nweed and writing jokes?\nPanic flashes over Troy.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D)\nOkay, so what? Is it the spotlight\nKurt gets? You want to be on...tv\nor something? You know how many\nBlack men waste their lives to get\non TV? Be rappers and ball players?\nTROY\n(wanting it to be true)\nDad no. I want what we always\ntalked about. Maybe have my own\nfirm someday? Run for office. Make\na difference. Wife. Kids. I want\nall that. I really really do.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAnd the drugs? God damn it Troy I\ntaught you better than this. I have\nbeen in academia a long time, I\u2019ve\nseen a lot of things. The men who\nreally run this world? You got no\nidea what they see when they see\nyou. You are not going to be what\nthey all think you are. You will\nnot give them that satisfaction,\nyou hear me?\nTROY\nYes sir.\n73 INT. PRESIDENT\u2019S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73\nSam steps out of Fletcher\u2019s office into the waiting room.\nKurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other\ndown as Kurt enters his father\u2019s office.\nA SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit\nthe room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through\nthe window.\nSam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and\nlistens in.\n76.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nI know about the party. You picked\na hell of a time.\nKURT\nWhat party --\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\n-- You\u2019re cancelling Kurt. End of\nstory.\n75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75\nLionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over\nhears...\nGEORGE (O.S.)\nLionel\u2019s story on the would-be\nprotest outside of Gillespie is\nrunning tomorrow and I\u2019m also\nhaving Lionel work on a profile\npiece of Armstrong/Parker like you\nsuggested. Really break down what\u2019s\ngoing on.\nLionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a\nphone call.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nRight. It\u2019s almost like they\nrecycle so much from their past -\nMusic, food, fashion, and now\nturbulence.\nThis leaves a bitter taste in Lionel\u2019s mouth.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nThank you so much. Okay, take care.\nGeorge can\u2019t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.\nANNIE\nWell?\nGEORGE\nThat was our Times advisor. He said\nit\u2019s stories like these that get\neditors recommendation letters.\nLionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but\nreassured when they see who it is.\n77.\nLIONEL\nThe Negro at the door didn\u2019t scare\nyou this time.\nAnnie smiles and heads for the door.\nANNIE\nLionel please. You\u2019re only\ntechnically Black. G, going to\nFrench. You want me to hold your\nseat?\nGEORGE\nThanks.\nAnnie smiles and walks out.\nLIONEL\nYou need something? Saw your email.\nGEORGE\nYeah, I need someone to do the\nDonor\u2019s function on Saturday.

You\u2019ll do fine.\nLIONEL\nI don\u2019t know. Are there going to be\nany racially fueled outbursts at\nthis thing?\nGEORGE\nNever know right?\n78.\nIt\u2019s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.\nLIONEL\nAm I a good writer?\nGEORGE\nYou\u2019ll get better. And we need you\nright now.\nLIONEL\nYou\u2019re just a big recommendation\naway from landing the Times.\nGEORGE\nGod I hope so.\nLionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nHey.\n-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So\ninstead he just kisses him.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m glad we finally got that Bugle\non your chest.\nLionel\u2019s all mixed up.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nThere\u2019s a big party the night of\nthe Donor\u2019s event.

TROY\u2019S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76\nTroy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag\nto reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He\u2019s getting\nready for something.\nHis phone buzzes with a notification: \u201cMessage from:\nPASTICHE\u201d\nTroy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...\n79.\nKURT (V.O.)\nDear White People.

He smokes on Coco\u2019s one-hitter from before.\nLionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.\nThe two are surprised to see each other.\nLIONEL\nFunny seeing you here.\nTROY\nFather likes to show me off at all\nthe Donor functions. The dessert\ncourse is usually my cue to take a\nbreather while they talk shop.\n(friendlier)\nThe trick is to dazzle them into\nforking over their estates just\nbefore they kick the bucket.\nLionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.\nLIONEL\nSo...Picard or Kirk?\nTROY\nKirk. Wait...\nLIONEL\nI saw you watching Star --\n81.\nKURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nTROY\n-- Yo what happens in the crib\nstays in the crib.

That work out for you?\nLIONEL\nNo. No it did not. At least not in\nHigh School. I bet there\u2019s a statue\nof you at your High School.\nTROY\nI was beloved. Won\u2019t lie.\nLIONEL\nDid they know you were a trekker?\nTROY\nMy pops left a paint by numbers\ntemplate for success at that High\nSchool. All I had to do was fill in\nthe blanks. Football captain.\nValedictorian. Prom King.\nLionel sees a sadness in Troy.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nSo what? You\u2019re growing that out?\nLIONEL\nI think it\u2019s gaining sentience.\nTROY\nIt\u2019s...out there.\nLIONEL\nIt\u2019s like a black hole for white\npeople\u2019s fingers.

KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 79\nThe party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in\ncostume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as\npimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack\nObama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.\nIt\u2019s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with\n\u201cPurple Drank.\u201d Everyone downs the stuff.\nINT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT\nTroy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.\nTROY\n...my own firm. Maybe run for\noffice. Make a difference you know?\n83.\nThe couple smile.

KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 80\nLionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously\nput up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel\nglances at the posters - it\u2019s Kurt with a large Afro wig\nmimicking Sam\u2019s \u201cMissing Black Culture\u201d flyers.\nLIONEL\nThis is kind of fucked up. Right?\nGEORGE\nPastiche. The world\u2019s most erudite\nboneheads. Who wants another round?\nCome on Lionel, help a brother out.\nLIONEL\nKitchen\u2019s this way.\n80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A\nCoco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She\u2019s\nfeeling herself as she\u2019s handed a drink.\nShe\u2019s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a\nparty. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.\nHer confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath\nher party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...\nCOCO\nHey there muffins. How do I look?\nWhy are white folks so obsessed\nwith being Black? And why are Black\nfolks so addicted to Blonde Barbie\ndoll weaves? Honeys it\u2019s a strange\nsymbiosis we\u2019re here to explore...\nCoco\u2019s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her\niPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.\n80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B\nLionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the\nkitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...\n80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C\n...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales\nLionel\u2019s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel\u2019s hair.\n84.\nLIONEL\nOuch.\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nLIONEL\nIt\u2019s okay. Can\u2019t wait to cut all\nthis off.\nGEORGE\nDon\u2019t you dare.\nGeorge plunges his fingers into Lionel\u2019s fro once again.\nPulls a touch too hard.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nI could eat you like a Hershey\u2019s.\nThis sets something off in Lionel.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019ll be right back.\nLionel breaks George\u2019s grasp and heads out the bathroom...\nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n...and back out into the party. He\u2019s trapped in a nightmare\nof caricatures and reveling students. Can\u2019t breathe.\nEXT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT\nLionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his\nhead as he starts walking away from the party.\nJust then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some\nfriends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.\nKURT\nWhat the hell?\n81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81\nLionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the\ndining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.\nDINING HALL\nSAM\nFor a genius dude you\u2019re a fucking\nidiot.\n85.\nREGGIE\nI did it, we did it for you.\nSAM\nI didn\u2019t ask for it Reggie. I look\nlike I betrayed this house.\nREGGIE\nYeah? Well you betrayed me.\nSam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.\nLIONEL\nSam? Can we talk?\nSam turns back around fiercely.\n82 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 82\nA turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED\nLIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.\nThe crowd starts to get live now.\nCoco continues to make her way through the party - her face\nvisibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She\ncontinues out back...\n83 EXT. KURT\u2019S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83\n...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a\nlong straight Black wig and brag to friends...\nANNIE\nHey who am I? \u201cBitch it\u2019s weave.\nNoun. Present tense ho!\u201d\nRight in the gut. She\u2019s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...\n84 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84\nKurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give\nhim props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the\nothers. His phone rings.\nKURT\nYeah?\nINTERCUT\nCOCO\nKurt, it\u2019s me. I can\u2019t do this.\n86.\nKURT\nOkay, I\u2019m fucking confused.\n85 INT. SAM\u2019S ROOM - NIGHT 85\nLionel sits across from Sam.\nSAM\nWhat do you want me to do? Go over\nthere and yell at them?\nLIONEL\nHave you heard you yelling?\nSAM\nThis house is filled with folks\nwilling to take up after a cause\nLionel. Believe me. Never would\nhave guessed you\u2019d be one of them\nbut...\nLIONEL\nFor the first time in my life, I\ncan\u2019t just sit around and do\nnothing. How can you?\nSAM\nIf I\u2019m caught being a part of\nanything like this...it wouldn\u2019t be\ngood for me right now okay?\nLionel gets up and walks towards the door.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m done being everybody\u2019s angry\nBlack chick.\nSam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.\nSam\u2019s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and\nthen to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.\n86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86\nLionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining\nroom - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other\nstudents mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.\n86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A\nLionel gingerly walks in the room. He\u2019s still an outsider\nhere - but something\u2019s changed in him.\n87.\nLIONEL\nHey. How\u2019s it going. Hi.\nNo one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.\nLionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nHey...what is this?\nSUNGMI\nBlack Student Union.\nLionel smiles shyly. He should\u2019ve known that.\nReggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.\nDREADS\nYour call then man.\nREGGIE\n(to everyone)\nAlright ya\u2019ll - thanks for coming\nout tonight. Looks like Sam\u2019s not\nmaking it so...let\u2019s just call it.\nThe crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and\nleave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...\nLIONEL\nUh. Excuse me. Hi. I\u2019m Lionel. Some\nof you...none of you probably know\nme. I\u2019ve never been to a meeting.\nBut I just came back from a party\non campus and I think you should\nknow about it.\nLionel\u2019s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He\u2019s got the\njudging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an\nopen laptop on a desk.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nAnybody mind if I?\nReggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up\nthe party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel\nbrowses through the photos.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nI mean...I don\u2019t know. This is\nfucked up right?\nREGGIE\nAlright brother. What\u2019s the plan?\n88.\nLionel realizes the eyes aren\u2019t judging. They\u2019re mobilizing.\nReadying for action. Lionel steels himself.\nLIONEL\nWe go over there. Now.\nCURLS\nThink there\u2019s enough of us?\nSUNGMI\nYou know you don\u2019t have a monopoly\non being a pissed off minority.\nLatino\u2019s United is meeting across\nthe hall. Asian American League\ntoo.\n(off the stares)\nYou guys got better snacks.\n87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87\nTroy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads\nfrom the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.\nShoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table\ncovered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to\nhis father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President\nFletcher.\nTROY\nDad...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNot now Troy.\nTROY\nIt\u2019s important. There\u2019s something\nhappening on campus. I might\u2019ve...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou\u2019re being rude son.\nDean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--\nTROY\nOh am I? How about I tell your\nprecious donors and anyone here\nwho\u2019ll listen about the kind of a\nschool it is they\u2019re giving to?\nThe Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on\nhim - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.\n89.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI don\u2019t know who you think you are\nyoung man but you don\u2019t get to talk\nto your father any kind of way.\nTROY\nAll I say to you is yes sir and no\nsir! Look I should\u2019ve brought this\nup before but --\n(off Fairbanks dismissal)\n-- listen to me!\nDean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.\n88 INT. KURT\u2019S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88\nKurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.\nKURT\nWhat?\nGORDON\nYeah dude. We all got it. I mean,\neverything\u2019s cool right?\nA noise in the other room startles them...\n88A LIVING ROOM 88A\n...It\u2019s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues\nwith a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid\u2019s face. The\nparty swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.\nA SMASH yanks Kurt\u2019s attention back to the kitchen...\n88B KITCHEN 88B\n...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.\nKURT\nLionel?\nKurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\nThe fuck you think you\u2019re doing\nman?\nLionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids\nflood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\nThat all you got?\n90.\nLIONEL\nWe\u2019re putting an end to this Kurt.\nKURT\nFuck you I\u2019m calling the cops.\nMARTIN\nHalf of this crowd is under 21.\nA loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the\nLiving Room.\n88C LIVING ROOM 88C\nMitch has taken over the mic.\nMITCH\nGimme that mic\nBefore I slap ya\nLooking for some dykes,\nthat wanna another chapta.\nIf you do me slow,\nyou can do me faster,\nI\u2019ll pass you to the Nigga on my\nright, he gets you after.\nLIONEL\nKurt--\nKURT\n-- Why don\u2019t you tuck your tail\nbetween your legs, run and tell the\nDean and get the fuck out.\nLionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU\nwatches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.\nLionel turns to go and spots...\n...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right\nbehind George is...\n...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed\nat the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.\nLionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.\nLionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of\none of the rapper\u2019s hands.\nLIONEL\nHeyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!\n91.\nThe crowd is with it - thinks it\u2019s part of the show as Lionel\nproceeds to freestyle terribly...\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nMy name is Lionel,\nSome people call me Li.\nLots of people think\nthat I talk kinda white.\nWell that\u2019s alright.\nYeah that\u2019s cool.\nI\u2019d rather you think I\u2019m white,\nthan tap dance for you.\nWith that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He\nthen takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.\nSparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.\nLionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.\nLionel\u2019s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes\nKurt away in his defense.\nGordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.\nMore equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the\nparty disintegrates into chaos.\nSam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.\nArt is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on\nthe ground. Arguments come to physical blows.\nThe steel in Sam\u2019s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?\nAnd then she spots...\n...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.\nSam\u2019s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.\nCOCO\nWhat? Say it. Come on.\nSam stays silent.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nThis may come as a shock, but these\npeople don\u2019t give a fuck about no\nHarriet muthafuckin Tubman. They\npay millions of dollars on their\ntans, their lips, their asses, Jay-\nZ tickets, you name it, cause they\nwanna be us.\n92.\n(MORE)\nSo they got to be for a night.I\u2019m\nnot about to go out into the\nstreets in protest of a Halloween\nparty.\nSam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco\nrealizes it\u2019s herself she\u2019s trying to convince.\nCoco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is\nnew for her. Keeping her mouth shut.\n89 EXT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 89\nCoco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her\nlashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.\n90 EXT. KURT\u2019S YARD - NIGHT 90\nKurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the\nground.\nKURT\nDude. I know you can\u2019t help it...\nLionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\n...but why are you such a fag dude?\nLionel spits in Kurt\u2019s face and pops right back up again. We\nsee it in his eyes - he\u2019ll never give up.\nKurt\u2019s hand is on Lionel\u2019s collar. He pushes him down again.\nKids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -\nsome from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.\nLionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt\u2019s eyes.\nLionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.\nLIONEL\nFinally got me where you want me.\nKurt\u2019s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.\nLionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as\nwell. No time to soak this in though. Kurt\u2019s let up. For a\nmoment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the\nface. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.\nThe shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.\nThe world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort\nof makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.\n93.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nKids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -\nOne is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a\ncouple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.\n91 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 91\nThe motor on Sam\u2019s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a\ncomplete standstill.\nTroy enters and looks around in disbelief.

AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92\nA SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN\nWe see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.\nCUT TO:\n92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A\nparty. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.\nWindows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the\nlawn. Ash where fires were put out.\nKURT\nI didn\u2019t do this. Sam. I had\nnothing to do with this.\nCUT TO:\n92B MORNING NEWS 92B\nANCHOR\nWhat some are calling a \u201crace war\u201d\nhas erupted at one of the nation\u2019s\noldest and most prestigious --\nCUT TO:\n92 GILLESPIE FORUM now filled with students who sit before 92\nDean Fairbanks and President Fletcher for a Town Hall.\nEveryone wears a look of outrage.\n94.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWe don\u2019t condone this egregious\nevent and are investigating its\norigins.

But so do boos.\nCUT TO:\n93 VARIOUS SPOTS AROUND CAMPUS. Students address the camera. 93\nMITCH\nI\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s bullshit. Yo\nthis is how we get down.

It\nwas the right thing to do. I didn\u2019t\nmean for all this to happen. All\nthe posters and everything.\nSAM (O.S.)\nBut you\u2019d welcome it? A shot for\nschool president.\nTROY\nI think...I\u2019d make more than few\npeople happy if I ran.\nCUT TO:\n93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. She 93D\nlingers.\nSAM (V.O.)\nEven though I\u2019d been expressly\nforbidden to do so, I wanted to do\none last show. Something to sum up\nthe moment. To savor in the pop of\nthe post racial bubble just burst.\nSAM\nDear White People...\nSAM (V.O.)\nI wanted to react.\nSam takes in a thoughtful breath before...\nSAM\n...Know what? Nevermind.\nShe fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her\nheadpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in:\n\u201c...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE\u201d\nSam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on,\nwhen all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE.

I told\nyou about the party, remember?\nCUT TO:\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94\nFacebook account.\nKURT\nI loathe Facebook.\nAn OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\nYou\u2019ve got to believe me.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou\u2019ve used that line on me before\nthis year Mr. Fletcher. When a\nhomophobic message mysteriously\nappeared on a voice mail line you\nshared with a roommate.\nCUT TO:\n98.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D)\nWhat were your intentions when you\nwent back the second time?\nLIONEL\nTo stop it.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nBy any means necessary?\nLIONEL\nSomeone once told me...Manchester\nis like jazz. I don\u2019t know much\nabout jazz. But from what I can\ntell, when your solo\u2019s up, you\nbetter blow.\nFairbanks fights a smile.\nCUT TO:\n94C SAM 94C\nAll I did that night was hit record\nbrother.\nThe Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and\nlooks out his huge windows onto the campus below.\nCUT TO:\n94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials 94E\nare taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day.\nThe Dean tries a few passwords.\nCUT TO:\n94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C\nWant to hear something strange?\nThe Dean turns from the window.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D)\nThe Pastiche group page hadn\u2019t been\nused for months, until the invite\nwent out.\nCUT TO:\n94E The Dean tries a different password. Still invalid. 94E\nCUT TO:\n99.\n94C SAM 94C\nFascinating.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWell what\u2019s interesting is how easy\nit was to access the group before\nthe note was sent. The password was\n\u201cPa$tiche\u201d spelled with a dollar\nsign according to Kurt. Seems\nrecently it\u2019s been changed.\nCUT TO:\n94E The Dean tries one more. It works. 94E\nCUT TO:\n94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D) 94C\nCouldn\u2019t figure it out at first.\nThen I thought to try something.\nFive, seven, eight, three, five,\ntwenty six, one, nine, four, six.\nEleven numbers. Just like our\nstudent ID numbers. Just like your\nstudent ID number.\nSAM\nAs much as you hate him, you will\nstop at nothing to protect your\nmaster and his boy.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDid you send out the invite Sam?\nSAM\nThat invite, whoever sent it\nshould\u2019ve been met with derision\nand outrage. Instead, a hundred\npeople showed up and they pulled\nout posters and decorations and\ncostumes they\u2019d made for just such\nan occasion.\nSam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.\nSilence falls in the room. The Dean\u2019s mind ticks.\n95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95\nA pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the\nheadline: \u201cINVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO\nEXPULSIONS MADE\u201d\n100.\nNext to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT\nOBSERVER. The headline reads: \u201cEBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE\nHARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS.\u201d\nGeorge picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...\n96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL\u2019S APARTMENT - DAY 96\nLionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied\ngrin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.\nLIONEL\n2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless\ncomplex depictions of whites, white\nmen in particular exist - there\naren\u2019t that many versions of us in\nthe culture.\nHis locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and\nfearless fro-hawk atop Lionel\u2019s head.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nCulture has a powerful way of\ntelling people what they can and\ncan\u2019t be. For people of color the\noptions are rather limited.\nTROY\nNext James Baldwin up in here. Wait\nhold on a sec.\nStar Trek is back from commercial break. Troy and Lionel\nwatch in silence.\n97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97\nGabe is just about finished with Lionel\u2019s article too. Looks\nup just in time to see...\nGABE\nHello Sam.\nSam sneers at his formalities.\nGABE (CONT\u2019D)\nRead about Armstrong / Parker.\nSAM\nYeah. Prez made an executive\nwithdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.\nGABE\nCongrats?\n101.\nSAM\n(with a shrug)\nGetting too dramatic man. Thinking\nabout getting an apartment off\ncampus. We\u2019ll see.\nGABE\nSam going against the grain?\nShocked. How\u2019s papa White?\nSAM\nHe\u2019s recovering.\nGABE\nGood. Well...\nGabe fights the urge to hug her.\nSAM\nWe were actually on the phone last\nnight for hours. First time we\ntalked since the bypass. He was\nputting up a strong front. Teasing\nme about being so worried. Then\ncame the stories about me as a\nlittle girl I\u2019d heard a thousand\ntimes. About how independent I was.\nGabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.\nGABE\nWant to talk about it?\nSAM\nMy mother worked nights so he would\ntake me to school. And it pissed me\noff because he would follow me all\nthe way to homeroom. Every time he\ntried to hold my hand I\u2019d scream\nand pull away. He thought I was\njust being...difficult.\nA hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nBut it was the kids. And the\nparents and the teachers. They\u2019d\nsee this Black girl and this white\nman and wonder what we were doing\ntogether. Even at nine I could feel\ntheir eyes on me. Especially at\nnine. It brought tears to my eyes.\nGabe\u2019s stone face melts at this.\n102.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nI was just a bratty girl, didn\u2019t\nknow any better but-- The thought\nof losing him-- You know? I just\nfeel so bad. How awful am I to do\nthat to him? To anyone I love?\nGabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His\narm is on her shoulder now.\nGABE\nI\u2019m sure he forgives you.\nSAM\nThink so?\nGabe nods. Sam\u2019s normal defenses come back up lest she cries.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nSo anyway. I didn\u2019t mean to say all\nof that. I don\u2019t know why I did.\nGABE\nSam. Where are you going?\nSAM\nI don\u2019t know. Lunch?\nGabe starts to walk with her.\nGABE\nIsn\u2019t it Mac and Cheese day at\nArmstrong/Parker?\nSAM\nThink they\u2019ll let you in?\nGabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam\nlets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into\neach others\u2019 eyes.\nDon\u2019t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.\n98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98\nCoco sits across from Helmut. He\u2019s got his eyes on a Youtube\nclip from Sam\u2019s movie featuring Coco.\nCOCO (YOUTUBE)\nI know this may come as a shock,\nbut they don\u2019t give a fuck about no\nHarriet muthafuckin Tubman...\n103.\nHELMUT\nTwo hundred thousand views. Look\nthey even auto-tuned it.\nWith a click Helmut pulls it up.\nAUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE)\nMuthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin\nTubman! Don\u2019t give a fuck about no\nmuthafuckin Tubman!\nCoco\u2019s not sure what to think.\nHELMUT\nCouple months, that\u2019s how long\nshooting for an episode takes. We\nrecommend you cut your course load\nin half to accommodate the\nschedule.\nCOCO\nHalf?\nHELMUT\nTrust me it it\u2019ll read \u201cfull-time\u201d\nin the episode. If...once we go to\nseries, we might have to figure out\na summer schedule.\nCOCO\nFor shooting?\nHELMUT\nFor uh...classes and stuff. Won\u2019t\nbe graduating early anymore\nsweetheart.\nHelmut shifts a contract over to Coco.\nHELMUT (CONT\u2019D)\nFive grand for the episode. Twenty\neach if you get picked up for\nseries. What do you say?\nCoco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.\nHELMUT (CONT\u2019D)\nTrust me sweetie it\u2019s the same out\nthere as it is in here. Good news\nis? Against all that damn white you\nand I? We pop. Think I wanted to be\nthe go-to producer for all things\nBlack?\n104.\nCoco shrugs.\nHELMUT (CONT\u2019D)\nTell you what\u2019s worse though. Being\nthat broke Nigga stuck on the south\nside of Chicago. Hundred and\nFiftieth street.\nCoco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --\n99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99\nCoco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He\u2019s flanked\nby his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other\nBoFros. They all carry Troy\u2019s \u201cNew Hope\u201d posters.\nCOCO\nMade some new friends?\nTroy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and\nshares a glance with Reggie, who doesn\u2019t approve.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nFine.\nTROY\nCome on Coco.\nCOCO\nFuck you.\nCoco starts to walk ahead.\nTROY\nMy dad saw your videos. He\u2019s a\nlittle worried about --\nCOCO\n-- how it\u2019ll look. With your\ncampaign and all. What\u2019s your best\nfriend Reggie think?\nTroy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.\nTROY\nWe had fun, alright?\nCOCO\nI get everyone else wants you to\nwin Troy. But do you?\nTroy doesn\u2019t know how to answer that. He stares at the\ntriumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.\n105.\nCoco\u2019s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of\nwho she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.\nWatching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and\nSungmi. They both know that look well...\nSAM\nHey Lionel. With me out and Troy\nmoving on - A/P\u2019s going to need a\nnew head of house.\nLIONEL\nThink there\u2019s a story there? Who do\nyou think it\u2019ll be?\nSam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nWhat? No.\nSUNGMI\nEveryone loves you. Won\u2019t be hard\nto rally the vote.\nSAM\nYeah. We got you man.\nLionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.\n100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100\nFairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher\u2019s office to join\nhim at his desk. They\u2019re all ears as they look across to...\nHELMUT\nLet me get this straight. First you\ntried to break up the Black house.\nThen you took down the sister with\nthe little radio show. And after\nall that, your kid throws a\nBlackface party?\nFLETCHER\nNow wait a minute!\nHELMUT\nYou thought you were having money\nproblems before? Wait till cable\ngets their hands on this story.\nBill Maher is gon\u2019 fuck you up!\nFLETCHER\nI have heard enough --\n106.\nHELMUT\n-- Wait I\u2019m sorry.

I\u2019m talking real money!\nTurns out the one thing America\nlikes in it\u2019s reality more than\nignant Black folks, is crazy racist\nWhite people!\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNow you look here. This is an\nhonorable institution. The idea\nthat we would so much as entertain\nthis suggestion --\nFletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.\nFLETCHER\nHow much we talking?\nFairbanks\u2019 outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one\nwinner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.\n100 CUT TO BLACK. 100\n107.1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
