 "lyrics": "When skies are cloudy and gray\nThey're only gray for a day\nSo wrap your troubles in dreams\nAnd dream your troubles away\n\nUntil that sunshine peeps through\nThere's only one thing to do\nJust wrap your troubles in dreams\nAnd dream all your troubles away\n\nYour castles may tumble, that's fate after all\nLife's really funny that way\nNo use to grumble, smile as they fall\nWeren't you king for a day?\n\nJust remember that sunshine\nAlways follows the rain\nSo wrap your troubles in dreams\nAnd dream your troubles away\n\nYour castles may tumble, that's fate after all\nLife's really funny that way\nBut no need to grumble, smile as they fall\nWeren't you king for a day?\n\nJust remember that sunshine\nAlways follows the rain\nSo wrap your troubles in dreams\nAnd dream, dream your troubles awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
