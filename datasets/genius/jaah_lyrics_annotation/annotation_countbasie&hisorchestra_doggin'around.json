                "Jesus Christ, often called the Messiah, died and rose three days later. Vic is using this metaphor as a way to talk about not only his career, as many believe it died and came back, but also how he almost got assassinated, like he will talk about later.\n\nJesus is also referred to as a lamb and a shepherd. Vic is saying that he might drive in his Lamborghini on his way to silence, or kill you. In the same way shepherds are known to silence their sheep when needed.\n\nFinally, Jesus came to spread his message, the Gospel. Gospel means truth in its origins. Just like Jesus, sharing his message is more important to him than being respected or like by the people. The people hated Jesus so much they crucified him, and Vic is afraid by spreading his Gospel, he will achieve the same fate."

The \u201cpass her off\u201d part, on the other hand, is simply a play on the term \u201cLateral pass\u201d, claiming that he is not one to cling on to any girl and once he cums he\u2019s done."

Em was also 23-years old during the making of his solo debut Infinite in 1996, although released after his October 17 birthday. Em also established the radio station Shade 45.\n\nDuring his first comeback for the 1994-95 season, Michael Jordan graced the court wearing the number 45 before switching back to the iconic 23. Vic cleverly weaved in Em\u2019s nickname and the age of when he got his first \u201cM\u201d \u2013 million dollars.\n\nAlso, the mention of the .45 caliber gun helps carry over to the following bars about the actual lethal consequences of messing with him.
