        "You\u2019re like a child. What\u2019ve I been\n telling you? Sometimes you\u2019ve gotta\n do the safe picture. Sometimes, you\n do it for art. Sometimes, it\u2019s the\n payback picture your friend says you\n owe him--",

                "The acting game is a hazardous road, too many mis-steps and you can fall off the relevance radar really quickly.  Ben is reminding Matt that it\u2019s ok to do the \u201cart picture\u201d that he actually want\u2019s to do, but that it\u2019s important to buffer them with the \u201csafe picture\u201d that\u2019s a guaranteed money maker or Emmy bait to stay relevant and in high demand.\n\nAnd then to suffix some real advice, Kevin Smith throws some of that classic self deprecating shade his own way, by getting Ben to break the 4th and 5th walls by possibly referring to how being in Kevin\u2019s most popular films has been helping Ben Affleck\u2019s career up to that point\n\nActual quote:\n\nYou\u2019re like a child. What\u2019ve I been telling you? You gotta do the safe picture. Then you can do the art picture. But then sometimes you gotta do the payback picture because your friend says you owe him."
