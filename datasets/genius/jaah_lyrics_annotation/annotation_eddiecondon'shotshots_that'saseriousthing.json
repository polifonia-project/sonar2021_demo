It also shows the focus on terms that have to do with tactics and war rather than practical questions. By far the most important thing this sentence shows is the characterization of Billy as the ever faithful soldier. He held onto all these unnecessary things because he was told to do so. It also shows his lack of experience of war in a way. He didn\u2019t understand that all these items might slow him down."

For one thing, Americans often think that \u201cthings\u201d will buy them happiness, and frequently these \u201cthings\u201d are useless pretty junk.\n\nBut more importantly, Vonnegut is criticising the platitudes found on gift shop trinkets, philosophically dumbed down phrases that have little or nothing to do with thinking. It is noted, that a cross (symbolising one\u2019s faith and devotion to God) is simply bought and sold in tacky giftshops."

Billy\u2019s perception of death, in that case, is total connection to the third eye chakra."
