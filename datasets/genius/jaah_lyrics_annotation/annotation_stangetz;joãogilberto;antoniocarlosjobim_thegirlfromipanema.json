However in this bridge section the lyrics become more reflexive and the singer starts comtemplating.\n\nThe chords being used in this section are strange to analyze when applying western music theory. This is very typically bossa nova, which makes is very distinguishable from other music styles."

Hel\u00f4 was probably one of the most beautiful women in all of Brazil, and did not care for any of the men (especially older ones) that stared at her all day while she was on the beach.\n\nHaving this as the last line in the single version really hammers home the tone of somber lonesomeness despite being in paradise. Although the girl is the most beautiful thing the songwriter has ever seen, he can\u2019t do anything about it. He shows that even when we are at the beautiful beaches of Rio, we are still affected by loneliness."

                "This lyric is suggestive of what the bossa nova artists were doing to Brazilian music. Samba is anything but gentle and cool. It does not sway or swing. It is energetic and powerful. The bossa nova artists moved away from the frenetic style of samba to a toned-down, minimalistic music for the more refined middle and upper classes. Thus, this description of the girl from Ipanema is a reflection of the changes that the bossa nova artists made to Brazilian music and culture."
