                "Saint Rumwold (Rumbold) was a medieval infant saint in England, said to have lived for three days in 662. He is said to have been full of Christian piety despite his young age, and able to speak from the moment of his birth, requested baptism, and delivered a sermon prior to his early death. Another Saint Rumbold (Rumold, Romuold) (died 775) was an Irish or Scottish Christian missionary who was martyred near Mechelen by two men, whom he had denounced for their evil ways.\nhttps://www.houseofnames.com/rumbold-family-crest"
