    "John Lennon wrote this in 1961 in the style of Smokey Robinson and The Miracles. It was one of 3 songs (along with \"It Won't Be Long\" and \"Not A Second Time\") that was written without McCartney for album With The Beatles. John stated: \"That's me trying to do Smokey Robinson again.\" This particular song was inspired by the Miracles song \"You Can Depend On Me.\"",
