  "facts": [
    "Ringo Starr wrote this and sang lead. It was the first Beatles song he wrote by himself.",
    "Ringo wrote this song in 1963. In an interview for a New Zealand radio station during their 1964 tour of Australia, Ringo is heard in the background saying \"sing the song I've written, just for a plug.\" Then, Paul says \"Ringo has written a song called 'Don't Pass Me By.' A beautiful melody. This is Ringo's first attempt at songwriting.\" At this point, Paul and John actually sing a verse of it and Ringo says, \"It was written as a country western, but Paul and John singing it with that blues feeling has knocked me out. Are the Beatles going to record it? I don't know. I don't think so, actually. I keep trying to push it on them every time we make an album.\" Paul then states, \"Unfortunately, there's never enough time to fit Ringo's song on an album. He never finished it.\" Ringo put the finishing touches on it while in Rishikesh, India.",
    "The original title was \"Some Kind of Friendly.\"",
    "This was #1 hit in Scandinavia."
