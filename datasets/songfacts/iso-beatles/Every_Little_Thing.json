    "Many sources say that John Lennon played the 12-string Rickenbacker opening signature lick, as well as the solo, since George Harrison showed up at Studio Two a couple of hours after the initial tracking was recorded. Some believe John \"borrowed\" George's guitar, which was already set up in Studio Two, while others claim it was George on the electric 12-string. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Barry Kesten - Bellmore, United States\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
