    "Paul McCartney wrote this after fixing the roof on his farm in Scotland. McCartney said the song was \"about the hole in the road where the rain gets in, a good old analogy.\"",
    "This was the first time The Beatles used a studio other than one owned and operated by their record label EMI. The takes in this new studio - Regent Sound Studio, located in Tottenham Court Road, London - were numbered 1-3. They returned to Abbey Road the next day however, recording \"A Day In The Life.\" \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Matt - Lancaster, PA\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "It was rumored that this was about heroin, as in \"getting a fix.\" There is no truth to this rumor.",
    "George Harrison became annoyed at the number of times Paul re-recorded vocals for this song, later saying he did almost nothing during the recording of the album but sit around all day listening to Paul singing the words \"Fixing a hole\" all day. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Jonathon - Clermont, FL\n                                                  \n                                                  "
