    "As a joke, George Harrison and Paul McCartney repeated \"tit\" on the backing vocals. Most people don't notice it or think they are singing something more innocent.",
    "This was one of John Lennon's favorite Beatles songs. He revealed in the January 1971 edition of Rolling Stone, that in this song he was, \"in a way, trying to say something or other about Christianity\" which he was \"opposed to at the time.\" He explained: \"I was just talking about Christianity in that - a thing like you have to be tortured to attain heaven. I'm only saying that I was talking about 'pain will lead to pleasure' in 'Girl' and that was sort of the Catholic Christian concept - be tortured and then it'll be alright, which seems to be a bit true but not in their concept of it. But I didn't believe in that, that you have to be tortured to attain anything, it just so happens that you were.\"",
    "Jackson Browne said in Rolling Stone magazines 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time issue: \"There was a tremendous intimacy in everything John Lennon did, combined with a formidable intellect. That is what makes him a great singer. In 'Girl,' he starts in this steely, high voice: 'Is there anybody going to listen to my story.' It's so impassioned, like somebody stepping from the shadows in a room. But when he comes to the chorus, you suddenly realize: He's talking directly to her. When I heard this, as a young teenager, it hit the nail on the head. It embodied the feelings I was living with every day - completely burning with sexual desire, with almost a regret at being so overpowered.\" \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France\n                                                  \n                                                  "
