    "This is an autobiographical song about John Lennon's life. He wrote most of the lyrics after being asked why a book he wrote, In His Own Write, revealed more about him than his songs did.",
    "The lyrics about friends refer to Stu Sutcliffe, an early Beatle and great friend of John's who died in 1962, and another friend named Pete Shotton. Lennon also thought of his Aunt Mimi and wife Cynthia, as well as other friends. One of the most beautiful Beatles songs, John called it \"A little piece of art work.\"",
    "The Beatles left a hole for the instrumental break when they recorded this. Producer George Martin filled it in the next morning by playing a piano solo and speeding up the tape to make it sound like a harpsichord. Lennon had asked him to fill it with something \"baroque.\"",
    "There's a good chance you know all the words to this song. The two verses tie together to tell a sweet and compelling story, with only the last line in each (\"In my life, I've loved them all\"; \"In my life, I love you more\") serving as the chorus. At the end of the song, this section repeats:\nThough I know I'll never lose affection\nFor people and things that went before\nI know I'll often stop and think about them\nIn my life, I love you more\nAfter a short George Harrison guitar break, John Lennon repeats the last line, but this time he breaks out his falsetto for the word \"my,\" a technique he also used on \"Revolution\" (\"You know it's gonna be all right\") and in \"Imagine\" (\"living life in peace, you-oh-oh-oh you may say I'm a dreamer\"). It makes for a very memorable lyric.",
    "Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney cited this as one of the best Beatles songs. It was also one of George Harrison's favorites. He performed a rocked-up version on his 1974 US tour, altering the lyrics a bit by singing \"I love you all\" and \"For people and things that came and went before.\"",
    "There is controversy over how involved McCartney was in writing this song. Lennon claimed in later interviews that he wrote the whole thing, while McCartney claimed it was an equal collaboration. In 2018, a Harvard statistician pegged it as a Lennon composition.",
    "This was voted the best song of all time by a panel of songwriters in a 2000 Mojo magazine poll. The panelists included McCartney, Brian Wilson, Lamont Dozier, and Carole King.",
    "In an interview in the January 1971 edition of Rolling Stone, John Lennon recalled the writing of this song: \"I wrote that in Kenwood (his home at the time). I used to write upstairs where I had about ten Brunell tape recorders all linked up, I still have them, I'd mastered them over the period of a year or two - I could never make a rock and roll record but I could make some far out stuff on it. I wrote it upstairs, that was one where I wrote the lyrics first and then sang it.\" He added that was usually the case with songs such as this one and \"Across the Universe\" and \"some of the ones that stand out a bit.\"",
    "Judy Collins, Ozzy Osbourne and Johnny Cash, Rod Stewart, Bette Midler, Diana Krall and Boyz II Men are among the many artists who have covered this song. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "According to John Lennon: The Life and Legend (The Sunday Times: A Special Tribute 1980), Lennon began writing this in 1964. He forgot about the song for a while and he wrote it again one year later, with lyrics talking about people from his childhood and younger years. In John's original handwritten lyrics he made reference to several places in Liverpool:\nPenny Lane is one I'm missing\nUp Church Rd to the clocktower\nIn the circle of the abbey\nI have seen some happy hours\nPast the tramsheds with no trams\nOn the 5 bus into town\nPast the Dutch and St. Columbus\nTo the Dockers Umbrella that they pilled down\nThe Dockers Umbrella was the world's first overhead railway (opened 1893). St. Columbus could refer to a school the bus passes. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Ian - Norwich, England\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "The music was inspired by The Miracles song \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me.\"",
    "This song was played at Kurt Cobain's funeral. The Beatles were an early and important music influence on him. Cobain even cited Lennon as his \"idol\" in the various journals he kept throughout his career with Nirvana. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Ashlynd - Charleston, WV\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "Dave Matthews played this at the 2001 special Come Together: A Night For John Lennon's Words And Music. The song took on new meaning, as the show aired three weeks after the terrorist attacks on America.",
    "In a sign that Sarah McLachlan's \"I Will Remember You\" is not somehow mandated as the background music for any death montage, James Taylor performed \"In My Life\" at the 2010 Oscars when they showed who died in the past year. Rests in the music were filled with dialogue from film clips. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Breanna - Henderson, NV\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "Frequent Beatles photographer Robert Freeman took the album's cover shot of the unsmiling band in front of a garden hedge at Lennon's estate in Weybridge (Surrey, England). The off-kilter effect came by accident when one of the slides slipped and fell backward, but the guys, particularly McCartney, loved it. ",
    "The distinctive bubble font on the cover of Rubber Soul was created by graphic designer Charles Front. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2\n                                                  \n                                                  "
