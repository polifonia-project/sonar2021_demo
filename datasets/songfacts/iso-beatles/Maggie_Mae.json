  "facts": [
    "This is a traditional song about Liverpool prostitutes (\"Maggie\" is British slang for prostitute). Many British groups have recorded it.",
    "The Beatles used to play this when they were still known as The Quarrymen, including at the church fair when John Lennon met Paul McCartney.",
    "This was one of the songs they would use to warm up at recording sessions.",
    "The Beatles recorded this between takes of \"Two Of Us.\" The album was supposed to be a return to The Beatles early days when they played live, so this was left on. The album was delayed until after The Beatles broke up, so Phil Spector was brought in to produce it from the tapes.",
    "This was left off the album when it was released in 2003 without Phil Spector's orchestrations.",
    "This was the first song on a Beatles album since Help that was not written by any members of the band. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Adrian - Wilmington, DE\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
