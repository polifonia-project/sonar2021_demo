    "Five months after recording this, The Beatles started making a TV special with this as the title track. The special aired in the UK in 1967, but didn't appear in the US until 1976 when it was released in theaters, becoming the fourth Beatles movie.

    "When they started recording this, they only had the title, a little bit of music, and the first line. Paul McCartney wrote the verses, John Lennon the refrain. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France\n                                                  \n                                                  ",

    "Charles Manson used to refer to life as \"A Magical Mystery Tour\" after hearing this song. He later warped other Beatles songs (\"Helter Skelter,\" \"Piggies,\" \"Blackbird\") to explain a race war named Helter Skelter.
