    "Left off the US version of Rubber Soul, this was released as the B-side to \"Nowhere Man\" in America. The song dates back to 1957, when the group was known as The Quarrymen. The Quarrymen were a Skiffle group, Skiffle being a king of music reminiscent of Country & Western with roots in Jazz, involving banjos and various improvised instruments such as a washboard and a washtub. John Lennon was tremendously influenced by Lonnie Donegan, and The Quarrymen in fact covered several Donegan songs. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "Ringo helped Lennon and McCartney write this and received his first songwriting credit for it - the composition credit on most Beatles songs is Lennon/McCartney, but this is credited to Lennon/McCartney/Starkey. Ringo also sang lead.\nIncidentally, this song being partially credited to \"Starkey\" is a good time to point out that Ringo Starr's actual name is \"Richard Starkey,\" a fact even some Beatles fans seem to be in the dark about.\nWhat was Ringo's comment on having received his first song-writing credit? At a 1966 press conference for the album, Ringo jested in his typical self-deprecating style that he'd written \"About five words, and I haven't done a thing since!\"",
    "John Lennon can be heard answering Ringo's vocal \"Tell me why,\" with \"I already told you why,\" A reference to their earlier song \"Tell Me Why.\"",
    "\"What Goes On\" is considered a follow-up to \"Please Please Me.\" Both songs have lyrics revolving around pining for a lover who doesn't love them back, and asking why it has to be that way."
