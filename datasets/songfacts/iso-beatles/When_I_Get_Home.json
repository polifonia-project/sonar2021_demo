    "John Lennon wrote the lyrics to this song, which is about going home to his girlfriend.",
    "A Hard Day's Night was the first Beatles album made up of all original Lennon/McCartney songs. The title came from something Ringo said during a radio interview. The UK version of the album featured a montage of head shots of the band members; the US version had one shot of each, showing only eyes and hair. It hit #1 in both the UK and the US. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2\n                                                  \n                                                  "
