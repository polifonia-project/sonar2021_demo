    "It was originally uncertain whether this 53-second oddity would be included on The White Album. According to Paul McCartney, the fact that George's then wife, Pattie Harrison, liked this piece a great deal sealed its inclusion.",
    "All instruments and vocals were performed byl McCartney. In their later years, The Beatles often recorded their parts separately.",
    "This evolved out of an impromptu sing-along at the Maharishi's retreat in India. The band went there to study meditation in 1968.",
    "This song was another that contributed to Charles Manson's belief that the Beatles were singing to him. According to the book Helter Skelter, the lines, \"Honey pie sail across the Atlantic\" meant that The Beatles wanted to meet him. Also from the song, Manson believed that Paul McCartney was saying he wanted Manson to put out a record. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Breanna - Henderson, NV\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
