    "George Harrison's songwriting would evolve over the next few years and flourish with introspective compositions like \"Something\" and \"Within You Without You,\" but on this song, he wrote about being in love with a girl and knowing that despite her threats, she will never leave him. After all, she likes him too much.",
    "Both a Steinway grand piano and a Hohner Pianet electric piano were used on this song. The Beatles didn't use much electric piano, but the Hohner Pianet also showed up on another song from Help!: \"The Night Before.\" \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Maya - Richmond, BC\n                                                  \n                                                  "
