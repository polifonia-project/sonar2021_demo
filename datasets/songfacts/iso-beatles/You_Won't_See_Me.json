    "Up to this point, McCartney wrote lots of \"silly love songs. \"You Won't See Me\" was a departure lyrically, as the song was more personal and mature, and also a little bitter, which reflects how he felt about his relationship with Jane Asher. Another Rubber Soul song, \"I'm Looking Through You,\" is also about Asher and is similarly scathing. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Bertrand - Paris, France\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
