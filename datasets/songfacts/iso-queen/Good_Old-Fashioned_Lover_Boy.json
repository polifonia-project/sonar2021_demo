    "This song, which was written by Freddie Mercury, features sound engineer and co-producer Mike Stone taking over the lead vocals for one line: \"Hey, boy, where'd you get it from? Hey, boy, where did you go?\" \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Gian Maria - Udine, Italy\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "Discussing the song in an interview with Kenny Everett on his radio show, Freddie Mercury described the song thus: \"It's in my 'ragtime' mood that I get a chance to, [Laughs] to do on every album and this time, this is something I've come up with this time around.\" \nThis links to his comments about \"Seaside Rendezvous\" about wanting to do more 'vaudeville' style songs in the future (\"Seaside Rendezvous was featured on previous album A Night At The Opera). Everett described it as \"a little frilly number from the pen of Fred.\"\nOn an aside, Everett is an important part of Queen history - when \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was first proposed as a single, Queen's record company refused to put it out, and demanded a cut-down version be produced. One was actually made, but the band eventually stood firm and insisted they wanted the full-length version to go out, and were backed by manager John Reid. Everett visited the studio where they were recording, heard \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and fell in love with it. He then stole a copy (stories vary on whether he was given a copy or stole one) of the song, and played it intensely on his radio show across one weekend - which helped break the song and make it a huge hit before it was even officially released."
