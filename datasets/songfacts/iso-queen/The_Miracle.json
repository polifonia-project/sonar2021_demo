    "Freddie Mercury was the principle composer of this song, though John Deacon contributed some of the chords and all four of the band members came up with lyrical ideas. It was the fifth and last single from The Miracle album.",
    "This is a lighthearted song with simple lyrics. Freddie Mercury sings of God's magnificent creations and how beautiful they are, such as, \"The Taj Mahal,\" \"Test tube babies being born,\" \"the Hanging Gardens of Babylon,\" \"Captain Cook,\" \"Cain and Abel\" and \"Jimi Hendrix.\" Many see this as not only Mercury's appreciation of life so close to his eventual death, but as a subtle nod to Jimi Hendrix, who he has often cited as being an inspiration to him, Queen, and many others. ",
    "Freddie Mercury pleads during the song for \"Peace on Earth and end to war\" and a day \"when we can all be friends\" - Mercury has suggested peace on Earth throughout his career, but this is clearly the most noticeable use of the message, as it is the central theme of the song. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n James - Vancouver, Canada, for all above\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
    "In Hard 'N' Heavy video magazine (1989, vol. 3), Brian May said: \"We got pasted to the wall for this in England. Everybody hated it, for some reason. It's very uncool to be idealistic in Britain, I suppose, at the moment, and they said, 'How can they talk about peace,' and all that sort of stuff, then of course, China happened and everything. It seems very relevant to us.\"\nRoger Taylor added: \"In England 'idealism' is 'naivety,' which is wrong, it's not. There's nothing wrong with idealism. Nick Lowe wrote that great song, great title - 'What's so bad about peace, love and understanding,' yeah, and what is so bad about.\""
