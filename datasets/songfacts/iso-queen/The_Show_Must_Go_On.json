    "Guitarist Brian May wrote this while lead singer Freddie Mercury was dying of AIDS. It was Mercury's last official album with Queen, and when it was released, very few people knew he had the disease.\nThe lyrics are about the need to press on and make the most out of life while you can still enjoy it. It is inevitably a comment on Mercury's worsening condition, and his attitude towards life - May noted his incredible courage in the Days of our Lives documentary. \"He never moaned, he never said 'my life is s--t, this is terrible, I hate it,'\" said May. \"He had an incredible strength and peace.\"\nThe song's placing as the final track on Innuendo is notable, as it's likely that the band thought that this might be the last album Mercury would be healthy enough to perform on before his death. In the sessions, he made enough recordings to provide the band with material to release the posthumous 1995 album Made In Heaven.",

    "The video is mainly just clips of old Queen videos and a few live performances, but it is so cleverly edited and spliced together that it works as a video of it's own. \n                                                  >>\n                                                  \n                                                  Suggestion credit:\n Mjn Seifer - England\n                                                  \n                                                  ",
