You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

[Verse 2]
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

[Bridge]
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

[Bridge]
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore

I was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime
I was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime
Now since you got plenty money, you have thrown two good gals down

[Verse 2]
Once ain't for always and two ain't for twice
Once ain't for always and two ain't for twice
When you get a good gal, you'd better treat her nice

[Verse 3]
When you were lonesome, I treated you kind
When you were lonesome, I treated you kind
But since you've got money, it has changed your mind

[Verse 4]
I'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye
I'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye
But I'll write you a letter and tell you the reason why

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_The%20Man%20I%20Love_Coleman%20Hawkins%20Quartet.ttl,The Last Poets,Bird’s Word,"Everything was silent
And then Ma Rainey spread Black News
By way of the Backwater Blues
As Bessie Smith picked up on it
And spread the word, thru music and song
Then the message passed on
To Chick Webb, King Oliver, Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton
And they played the word and passed it along to Louis Armstrong
Fats Navarro, Charlie Ventura, Roy Eldridge and Fats Waller
Who was known to holler
The joint is jumpin with a Fatman's joy
As everybody started Stompin' at the Savoy
Then the word grew strong, as the immortal Bird came along
And blew all the Blackness that was true
With some Be-Bop brand new
Turning everybody on, with his unforgettable horn
As Lester Young became the first Prez of our race
And we turned around and dug on the beautiful face of Billie Holiday
As Billie began to sing praises to the blackman's thing
The good Brother Monk threw in some funk
So that the whole world could see
What he is, was and always will be
A genius creatively!
Then Miles began to set new styles
That put us miles ahead
As Dizzy set us free to be ourselves
And ride to heaven from hell in the latest
El-Do-Ra-Do, comin' far to carry us home!
Then Dinah sang finer
As Duke and Ella rode to fame
Goin' to Harlem on the A train
And we tuned into Charlie Mingus's bass
Setting a soulful pace
That let us taste the down sound
That found our hearts beating to the voice and drums
Of Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach
In their hip approach to Blackness!
Then Eddie Jefferson crooned an original tune
As Lambert, Hendricks and Ross scatted a new course
And we sampled King Pleasure's treasure
And listened to James Moody's moans
And then dug the dynamite drums of Brother Philly Joe Jones!
As Milt Jackson played the vibes in leaps and strides
With the MJQ (MJQ = Modern Jazz Quartet)
That sped our prides into sophisticate funkiness
Meanwhile, Sonny Rollins was building a bridge
For us to leave behind our grief
For the soulful relief
To find our own black minds
To tune in on Bud Powell
Who played the piano with funky hands
As he filled the seats and made 'em stand
On funky nights down Birdland (jazz club in NYC)
Then the Mighty Hawk made his horn talk (Coleman Hawkins)
And we heard Baby Ray play What'd I say
And jammed the set to dig Ornette
As Art Blakey broke free
Spreadin' the message to you and me
To dig on the trumpet of KD (KD = Kenny Dorham)
As we broadened our range
And counted our change with Basie
As Earl Fatha Hines blew our minds
And we grew fonder of Errol Garner
As Eddie Harris bent our ear talkin' bout Listen Here
And Eric Dolphy made his stand
With a side called Ironman
And Gene Ammons told his soul
And we mined Horace's Silver
That bought funky gold
Then Oscar Brown and Joe Williams got down
And we spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around
Spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around
Spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around
And dug Clifford Brown
Wowin' a sweet funky sound of soul
With a rhythm of gold
And along, and along, and along, and along, and along, and along, and along
And along, and along, and along, and along, and along, and along
And along, and along, and along, and along
Came 'trane!
Who blew away all the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain
All the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain
In the name of all the Black People on the Planet Earth
And all the stars in the cosmic universe!
As Brother 'trane blew to the East
To destroy the beast
And bring back Peace to Black People!
And everybody heard the majestic word of trane's horn
Telling us of a Love Supreme for Black People
That grew strong, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
From the soul, from the heart
From the spirit, from the brain
From the love of Brother John Coltrane!
Then Jimmy Smith got funky with it
And preached a sermon not to Walk on the Wild Side
But ride with Wes Montgomery
Who played his best everyday in our life
As Shirley Scott's organ got hot
And she and Stanley set more funk free! (Stanley Turrentine)
As Ahmad Jamal played with renewed ability
To give our minds some Tranquility
So that we could listen to an in-soul depth
Brother Archie Shepp
As Jackie McLean broke on the scene
Blowing mean and harder
For everybody to listen to Betty Carter
As Sun Ra shined
And Cannonball's horn whined
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!
So Sonny Stitt started piping it
And we couldn't get enough of brother Jack McDuff
As Freddie Hubbard began to bud
And we heard from Donald Byrd
And they'll be no others like the Ayter Brothers
Then Wayne Shorter grew taller
And our ship left dock with Herbie Hancock
As we rolled with Lee Morgan
And Grooved on Richard Holmes' organ
And then dug the soul of Art Tatum
Produce the sound that made him
As Rufus Harley blew an old new type bagpipe
That put the pants back on the man
An' Nina Simone groaned Mississippi Goddam!l
And Brother McCoy gave us peace and joy
As Elvin bought our freedom Jones down on us! (Elvin Jones)
Then Charles Lloyd filled the void
An' we watched Roland Kirk work!
And with a sigh of relief listened to Yusef Lateef
Blow in a flow of flurry's of peace from the east
As Pharaoh Sanders floated down the Nile with Brother Leon Thomas
To herald the promise of peace and happiness throughout the land!
All praises due to the Creator of the
Blackman!

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains

Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

I think you're fine
I'd like to love you

I get high when I see you go by
My, oh, my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Yes, it's so hard loving you, loving you"

Nothing to see
Just glad I'm living
And lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can't save a dollar
Ain't worth a cent
He doesn't hollar
He'd live in a tent
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way

Though he loves to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away
But why should I leave him
Why should I go
He'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got that man mad about me
He's funny that way

Never had nothing
No one to care
That's why I seem to have
More than my share
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way
When I hurt his feelings
Once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
End it all and let him go
To some better gal
But I'm only human
A coward at best
I'm more than certain
He'd follow me West

An airline ticket to romantic places
Still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words
That told you what my heart meant
A fair ground painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of march that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

How strange
How sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smouldering leaves the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

OVER BLACK WE SEE:

CHYRON

A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far
away--

EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY

We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from
sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK --
a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A
white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap
comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an
oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe,
and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in
the Mother's hands.
MOTHER
Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks
up the free cheese, 'kay?

She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly,
then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her
baseball cap and places it on the baby.

MOTHER
This'll keep the sun out of your
eyes. You be good now.

She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall.
With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his
mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks
kind of familiar.

Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS
concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair
enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip.
She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets
her Baby down beside him.

MOTHER
Don't fucking move, you little shit-
machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.
A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He
takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the
record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.

PASSERBY
Excuse me--who's watching these
babies?

MOTHER
The fat one's watching the little
one.

PASSERBY
Oh, nice parenting.
(walking away)
Leave'em out here like that and see
what happens.

The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.

MOTHER
FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!

PASSERBY
(waving her off)
Ah, keep on truckin'.
MOTHER
(to baby)
D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me
how to fuckin' raise you?
Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking
think he is? What's the worse fuckin'
thing could happen to you sitting
outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!

The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat.
Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing.
The smaller one says--

BABY
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

DISSOLVE TO:

THE PRESENT

JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record
Rack is now RST VIDEO.

Jay is mid-chant.

JAY
(as a chant)
--fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother
fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-
fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,
noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed,
smoking weed, doing coke, drinking
beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers,
rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who
smokes the blunts? We smoke the
blunts!

A pair of TEENS approach them.

TEEN 1
Lemme get a nickel bag.

JAY
Fifteen bucks, little man. Put that
shit in my hand. If the money does
not show, then you owe-me-owe-me-
owe.
(changing up to Morris
Day)
My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh!
I think I want to know ya', know ya'--

TEEN 1
(digging in pockets)
What the hell are you singing?

JAY
You don't know ""Jungle Love""? That
shit is the mad notes. Written by
God Herself and handed down to the
world's greatest band--the
motherfucking Time.

TEEN 2
The guys in that Prince movie?

TEEN 1
Purple Rain.

TEEN 2
Man, that shit was so gay--fucking
eighties style.

Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against
the wall.

JAY
Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind
word about The Time! Me and Silent
Bob modeled our whole fucking lives
after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a
smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and
Tubby here's my black manservant!

Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door
behind him.

RANDAL
What'd I tell you two about dealing
in front of the store? Drop the kid
and peddle your wares someplace else,
burn-boy.
(walking away)
And for the record, The Time sucked
ass.

He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After
a beat--

JAY
Yo-youse guys wanna hear something
fucked up about him and the Quick
Stop guy?

INT. QUICK STOP-DAY

Randal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a
customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the
counter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a
newspaper.

RANDAL
Hey, can't we do something about
those two stoners hanging around
outside all the time?

DANTE
Why? What'd they do now?

RANDAL
I'm trying to watch Clash of the
Titans, and all I can hear is the
two them screaming about Morris Day
at the top of their lungs.

DANTE
I thought the fat one didn't really
talk much.

RANDAL
What, am I producing an A&E Biography
about 'em? I'm just saying they
shouldn't be loitering around the
stores like they do.

DANTE
Neither should you, but we let you
stay.

RANDAL
See, man--if you were funnier than
that, ABC never would've canceled
us.

DANTE
What?

RANDAL
Nothing.

Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling.

TEEN 1
Two packs of Wraps.
(beat)
Yo--how was the service?

RANDAL
What service?

TEEN 2
The one at the Unitarian church where
you two got married to each other
last week.

RANDAL
What the hell are you talking about?

TEEN 1
Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed
wedding and you guys tied the knot
dressed like storm troopers.

TEEN 2
Yeah. And he said you're the bitch
and you're the butch. Oh, sorry--the
Leia and the Luke.

DANTE
I'm the bitch?!

RANDAL
Well if we were gay, that's how I'd
see it.

DANTE
Would you shut up?!

TEEN 1
(to TEEN 2)
Holy shit, dude. The honeymoon's
over.

DANTE
We're not married to each other.

TEEN 1
Well, sure. Not in the eyes of the
state or any real church, Skywalker.

RANDAL
(heading for the phone)
That does it. I'm gonna do something
about those two. I shoulda done a
long time ago

TEEN 2
In a galaxy far, far away!

TEEN 1
(exiting)
May the Foreskin be with you. Hand
Jabba the Hutt.

RANDAL
(into phone)
Yeah, I want to report a couple of
drug dealers out in front of the
Quick Stop.

EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a
COP, who frisks them.

JAY
What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we
do?

COP
We got a report that two guys were
hanging around outside the stores,
selling pot?

JAY
We don't smoke pot, yo.

Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.

TEEN 1
Here're the rolling papers you wanted
for your pot. And your change. Thanks.
(getting in Jay's
face)
And The Time sucks ass!

Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop
stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand.
He eyeballs the pair.

COP
No pot, hunh? What do you need this
for?

JAY
What?  I got a wiping problem. I
stick these little pieces of paper
over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit
stains in my undies.
(unbuttoning pants)
You don't believe me? Lemme show
you.

Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back
over his shoulder.

JAY
Just spread my cheeks a little and
you can see the fucking stink nuggets--

COP
Pull up your pants up sir, Now!

Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob
cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the
car.

COP
Let's take a ride down to the station.

JAY
What? It's suddenly a crime to fart,
motherfucker?!

EXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY

An ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red
Bank.

BRODIE (O.S.)
No fucking way!

WE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--

INT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER

BRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a
Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he
puts new books in the racks.

BRODIE
Dante and Randal slapped you with a
restraining order?!

JAY
Judge said if we go within a hundred
feet of the stores, we get thrown
into County.

BRODIE
So you gonna abide by the court's
ruling or you gonna go Bandit--
Reynolds style?

JAY
Fuck yeah! You know what they make
you do in county? Toss the fucking
salad! I don't like this fuck's
asshole; I'm gonna do it for some
stranger?

BRODIE
I guess if you really wanted to hang
out in from of a convenience store,
you could just buy your own now--
what with all that money you guys
made.

JAY
Hell yeah, bitch.
(beat)
Wait a second--what money?

BRODIE
The money from the movie, dumb-ass.

JAY
What the fuck are you babbling about?

BRODIE
(pulling a bagged-and-
boarded issue down
from the wall)
The Bluntman and Chronic movie.
(dawns on him)
Oh my God--don't tell me you have no
idea there's a movie being made of
the comic you two were the basis
for.

JAY
What?! Since when?

BRODIE
Goddamit, man--
(taps his wrist)
Here's the pulse, alright. And here's
your finger--
(shoves his hand down
the back of his pants)
--far from the pulse, jammed straight
up your ass.
(extracts hand and
extends it to Jay)
Say--would you like a chocolate
covered pretzel?

Brodie leads them back to the counter.

BRODIE
You see, kids, if you read Wizard,
you'd know it's the top story this
month.  Check it out.

Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to
the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get
Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL
AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and
Chronic.

JAY
When the fuck did this happen?!

BRODIE
Well, after X-Men hit at the box
office, all the studios started buying
up every comic property they could
get their hands on. Miramax optioned
Bluntman and Chronic.

JAY
Miramax? I thought they only made
classy flicks like The Piano and The
Crying Game?

BRODIE
Yeah, well once they made She's All
That, everything went to hell. So
you're saying you haven't gotten a
cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil
and Banky Edwards used to pay you
likeness rights for the comic book?

JAY
We haven't seen a fucking dime for
no movie!

BRODIE
Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think
Holden and Banky owe you some of the
proverbial phat cash. I mean they're
making a movie based on characters
that are based on you and Quiet
Robert.

JAY
It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a
pair of stupid-ass superheroes that
run around saying ""Snitchy-Nitchies""
or something.

BRODIE
I believe it ""Snootchie Boochies.""
Regardless--you're getting screwed.
If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden
McNeil and ask him for my movie check.

JAY
Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.

BRODIE
And on that note, we cue the music.

Jay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with
his own beat.

EXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building
and knock.

INT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.

HOLDEN
Well! I have been waiting years to
do this.
(smiles)
Look at these morose motherfuckers
right here. Smells like someone shit
in their cereal. Bunngg!

Jay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following
them.

JAY
What the fuck took you so long
answering your damn door? You trying
to talk another girlfriend of yours
into some of that gay-ass three-way
action with your buddy?

HOLDEN
No, I was just showering your mother's
stink off me after I gave her a quick
jump and sent her home. But now that
you mention it--
(to Bob)
Thanks, you know. You could've made
the moral of that story you told me
a bit more clear.

Silent Bob shrugs.

HOLDEN
So what brings you two dirt merchants
to my neck of the woods?

JAY
Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are
doing in your woods--

Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article.

JAY
Where's our motherfucking movie check?

HOLDEN
You heard about that too, Hunh? Well,
I've got nothing to do with it. That's
Banky's deal. He owns the property
now. I signed my half of the Bluntman
and Chronic right over to him years
ago.

JAY
Why the fuck would you do a thing
like that?

HOLDEN
Because I'm almost thirty, for God's
sake--why on earth would I want to
keep writing about characters whose
central preoccupations are weed and
dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,
man. Don't you ever want more for
yourself?
(off Silent Bob)
I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch
does. I look in his doe eyes and I
see a man crying out, ""When, Lord?
When the fuck can your servant ditch
this foul-mouthed little chucklehead
to whom I am a constant victim of
his folly, and who bombards me and
those around us with grade-A
foolishness that prevents me from
even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck!
When?!

Silent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at
him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.

JAY
I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're
the dumb-ass who gave away his comic,
and now you ain't got no fat movie
check neither.

HOLDEN
When you're right, you're right. I
wish I'd broken off a little piece
for myself. Because if the buzz is
any indication, the movie's gonna
make some huge bank.

JAY
What buzz?

HOLDEN
The Internet buzz.

JAY
What the fuck is the Internet?

INT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER

Holden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look
over his shoulder.

HOLDEN
The Internet is a communication device
that allows people the world over to
bitch about movies and share
pornography with one another.
(off monitor)
Here's what we're looking for: ""Movie
PoopShoot.com""

JAY
(to Bob)
""PoopChute."" Yeaaahhh.

HOLDEN
This is a site full of militant movie
buffs: sad bastards who live in their
parents' basements, downloading
scripts and trading what they believe
to be inside info about movies and
actors they despise yet can't stop
discussing. This is where you go if
you wanna hear frustrated would-be
filmmakers mouth off with their two-
bit, arm-chair-director's opinions
on how they all could've made a better
Episode One.

On the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up.
Holden begins navigating the site.

HOLDEN
Here. This is about the Bluntman
movie.
(reading)
""Inside sources tell me Miramax is
starting production this Friday on
their adaptation of underground comic
fave Bluntman and Chronic.""

JAY
Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's
playing us in the movie?

HOLDEN
No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure
it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
They put'em in a bunch of movies.

JAY
Who?

HOLDEN
You know--the guys from Good Will
Hunting.

JAY
You mean the fucking movie with Mork
from Ork in it?

HOLDEN
Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either.
Though Affleck was the bomb in
Phantoms.

JAY
Word, bitch. Phantoms like a
motherfucker.

Holden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again.

HOLDEN
Now down here is where you can gauge
the buzz. This is the Shoot Back
area. It's where people who read the
news get to chime in with their two
cents. Here's what a guy who goes by
the chick-magnet Net handle of ""Wampa-
One"" thinks about Bluntman and
Chronic.
(reading)
""Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid
alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only
work in small doses, if at all. They
don't deserve their own movie.""
(to Jay)
He's got a point.

JAY
Fuck him. What's the next one say?

HOLDEN
(reading)
""Bluntman and Chronic is the worst
comic I ever read. Jay and Silent
Bob are stupid characters. A couple
of stoners who spout dumb-ass
catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech
and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay
and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their
stupid asses.""

JAY
Who the fuck said that shit?!

HOLDEN
A guy who calls himself ""Magnolia-
Fan.""  Check out what the guy after
him said: ""Jay and Silent Bob are
terrible, one-note jokes that only
stoners laugh at.  They're fucking
clown shoes. If they were real, I'd
beat the shit out of them for being
so stupid. I can't believe Miramax
would have anything to so with this
shit. I, for one, will be boycotting
this movie. Who's with me?""
(leans back)
And then there are about fifty more
posts from people who agree to join
Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick.

JAY
(grimly)
I'm gonna kill all these fucks--

HOLDEN
Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a
bunch of jealous little dicks who
use the anonymity of the Net to insult
people who're doing what they wish
they were doing, and number two,
they're not really talking about you
guys--they talking about Bluntman
and Chronic.

JAY
But they said Jay and Silent Bob!
They used our real names. It doesn't
matter that there's a comic book
version of us and a real version,
'cause nobody knows we're real in
real life.

HOLDEN
Really.

JAY
Yeah! And all these people who read
that shit think the real Jay and
Silent Bob are a couple of faggots
'cause of that all these dicks are
writing about the comic book Jay and
Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me
and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,
and she'll be like ""Oooo! I want to
suck youse guys dicks off. What's
your names?""  And I'll be like, ""Jay
and Silent Bob."" And she'll be like,
""Oh--I read on the Internet that
youse guys were little fucking
jerkoffs.""  And then she goes and
sucks two other guys's dicks off
instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta
put a stop to these hateful sonsa-
bitches before they ruin our good
names!

HOLDEN
First off, I don't know how good
your names really are. Secondly,
there's not much you can do about
stopping this bile. The Internet's
given everyone in America a voice,
and everyone in American has chosen
to use that voice to bitch about
movies. As long as there's a Bluntman
and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are
gonna have something negative to say
about it.  Jay steams, thinking.
Then, a light dawns on him.

JAY
But wait a second--if there wasn't a
Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no
one would be saying shit about Jay
and Silent Bob, right?

HOLDEN
They're not saying anything about
you now--they're talking about
fictional characters!

JAY
(oblivious to Holden;
to Bob)
So all we gotta do is stop 'em from
making the movie!

HOLDEN
Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in royalties
you're due in the process. Are you
fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably
not alone in the opinion that this
flick is the worst idea since Greedo
shooting first. I mean, a Jay and
Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to
see that?

Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for
a beat. Then--

HOLDEN
But since it is happening, you might
as well just ignore the idiots on
the Internet, go find Banky, and get
your ""motherfucking movie check."" As
you so succinctly put it. That's
what's important here.

JAY
No, Holden McNeil--what's important
here is that there's a bunch of
motherfuckers we don't even know
calling us assholes on the Internet
to a bunch of teenagers and guys who
can't even get laid. Putting a stop
to that is the most important thing
we could ever do.
(off monitor)
When did it say they're making that
movie?

HOLDEN
They start this Friday.

JAY
So if today's Tuesday, that gives us--
(counts)
Eight days.

HOLDEN
It's more like three days.

JAY
Right. Three days to stop that stupid
fucking movie from getting made!
C'mon, Silent Bob--

Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.

JAY
We're going to Hollywood.

They stride off. Holden shakes his head.

HOLDEN
Now that's what I call the Blunt
leading the Blunt.

EXT. BUS STATION--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled ""Los
Angeles."" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After
a beat, they re-emerge.

JAY
Tickets? Since when did they start
charging for the bus?

They head toward the depot.

JAY
Didn't we used to ride that shit to
school every day for free?

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.

INT. BUS--SAME

Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER.

JAY
We in Hollywood yet?

DRIVER
It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles,
sir. We left twenty minutes ago.

JAY
I didn't ask you about Los Angeles.
I asked you about Hollywood.

DRIVER
Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.

JAY
Don't change the subject! Are we in
Hollywood yet or not?

DRIVER
Please sit down, sir.

Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.

JAY
Why don't you take your seat Ralph
Kramden--

Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.

JAY
I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't
shit to so on this bus.

Silent Bob mimes jerking off.

JAY
I already did that. Twice.

Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across
the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld
video game. He leans over to him.

JAY
Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.

CHILD
Leave me alone, little kid.

The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning
to Silent Bob.

JAY
That fuck called me a little kid and
gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!

Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, ""He's
ten years old.""

JAY
You're my muscle, ain'tcha?

Silent Bob kind of nods.

JAY
So go open a can of whup-ass on that
little fuck, and get me his game!

Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the
aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and
registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.

Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches
for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts
punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his
seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay
looks at Silent Bob.

JAY
You're one tough motherfucker, you
know that?

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The bus pulls over by the side of the road.

INT. BUS--DAY

The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the
bus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.

PASSENGER
They been in there going on half an
hour now! Two of them! Doing God
knows what!

The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.

DRIVER
This bus isn't moving another inch
unless you clear out of there right
now!

No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.

DRIVER
DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!
NOW!!

The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive
amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the
bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed
into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.

JAY
Um--I think something's burning back
here.

EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left
behind.

JAY
The whole fucking world's against
us, dude. I swear to God.

Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.

EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.

JAY
This sucks balls, man. How come we
ain't getting no rides?

VOICE
'Cause you're doing it all wrong.

Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.

GUY
You gotta induce the drivers a little.

JAY
Like how?

GUY
Like this.

The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head
For Ride.

JAY
Yeah, but what happens when you get
in the car, and you don't make with
the head? Don't they kick your ass
to the curb?

GUY
Sure--if you don't make with the
head.

Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--

JAY
Eww! You eat the cock?!?

GUY
Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred
miles across country. I'll take a
shot in the mouth.

JAY
Yeah, but we ain't gay.

GUY
Well, neither am I. But have you
seen the price of bus tickets lately?
Shit--I don't wanna cough up two
hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.

JAY
Well, I don't wanna cough up some
dude's sperm!

GUY
Don't be so suburban--this is the
new millennium. Gay, straight--it's
all the same now. There're no more
lines.

Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.

JAY
There's one. On this side of it, we
ain't gay.

GUY
All hitchers do this. Why do you
think people pick us up? If you get
a ride, it's expected--I don't care
who the driver is. It's the first
rule in the Book.

JAY
What book?

GUY
The unwritten Book of the Road.

A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy
points to it, as if to say ""See?"" The passenger-side door
opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He
looks out the window at Jay and Bob.

GUY
Follow the rules of the Book, and
you'll get where you're going in no
time.  Excuse me.

Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go
face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers
smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.

Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR
pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window
and leans toward them.

NUN
You two boys need a ride?

INT. CAR--LATER

The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back
seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.

NUN
You both don't have to sit back there.
One of you can sit up here with me.

Silent Bob shakes his head ""no"" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs
up front.

NUN
So where are you boys from?

JAY
New Jersey.

NUN
What brings you to Indiana?

JAY
We're going to Hollywood.

NUN
Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways
away.

JAY
Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.

NUN
Well, do unto others. That's what
the Book says.

JAY
(misinterpreting
completely)
Wait a minute--you follow the Book,
too?

NUN
I live my life by it.

JAY
Really? You?

NUN
Of course. You know how lonely it
gets on the road? Thanks to the Book,
I'm never alone--if you know what I
mean.

JAY
I guess. This guy back there explained
it to us. But I didn't think you'd
be into that.

NUN
Are you kidding? I've dedicated my
life to it. Every hour of every day.

JAY
Shit--you nuns are alright.

NUN
You live by the Book, too?

JAY
You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.

NUN
That's good to hear. But it takes
deed, not words. It's a lot easier
to say you live by the Book than to
actually do it.
(looks at him)
Can you do it?

JAY
You want me to do it right now?

NUN
No time like the present, right?

Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head
""no."" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and
starts to bend down.

JAY
Alright.
(he suddenly stops)
You hear that? She's not a Catholic.
She's a Presbyterian.

Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.

EXT. ROADSIDE--DAY

The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets
kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent
Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his
mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.

JAY
Dude--she had seventies bush.

EXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT

Jay and Bob continue hitching.

JAY
I can't believe this shit. Five hours
and not a single ride. Every day,
millions of people hitch to Hollywood
and stop studios from making movies
about 'em. But when you and me try
it, it's like we're trapped in a
fucking cartoon!

A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the
raid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,
and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.

INT. VAN--NIGHT

Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--

A clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed
Beauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.

Jay looks at Silent Bob.

JAY
Zoinks, yo

GUY
And now we can finally solve the
mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!
Pull off their masks and let's see
who they really are!

BOOKISH
I don't think they are masks.

BEAUTY
I don't think they're Hitchhiking
Girls either.

BOOKISH
Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.
(to herself)
Though I wish they were hitchhiking
girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking
girls--

GUY
Let's kick them out. We've got a
mystery to solve.

DUDE
The only mystery here is why we take
our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!

GUY
Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you
to the fucking dog!

BEAUTY
(covering her ears;
shrieking)
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!

JAY
YO!

The Gang look to Jay and Bob.

JAY
Youse guys need to turn those frowns
upside down! And we got just the
thing for that.
(pulls out a bag of
joints)
We call them Doobie Snax.

INT. VAN--WEED VISION

As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky
(with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze,
we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling
about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken
off to reveal a man inside a costume.

Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint
and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total
debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy
cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish
and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.
The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--

GREAT DANE
Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob

The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking
way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-
eyed.

JAY
Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's
got a stoner-boner!!!

Jay and Bob smile and pass out.

We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to
Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.

BEAUTY
I think they passed out.

GUY
Great. What do we do with them now?

DUDE
Let's cut out their kidneys to sell
on the black market and leave them
in a seedy motel bathtub full of
ice.

BOOKISH
Oh God, not again?

INT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT

Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar
on his back.

EXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY

Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as
well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see
the scar. It's not there.

JAY
Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.
(looks around)
Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get
some breakfast?

Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,
and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.

EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY

An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob
enter.

INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME

As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public
INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.

JAY
Yo--check that shit out: the Internet.
Let's see if those fucks said
something new about us and that stupid
flick.

Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar
and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look
at the screen and go wide-eyed.

JAY
""Any movie based on Jay and Silent
Bob is gonna lick balls, because
they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely
each other's.""

Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.

JAY
Eww.
(reading further)
""Yes--they are real people. Real
stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.""
(to Bob)
Motherfucker! It's time we wrote
something back! Type this shit down.

Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.

JAY
All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.
You are the ones who are the ball-
lickers.  We're gonna fuck your
mothers whole you watch and cry like
little bitches. Once we get to
Hollywood and find those Miramax
fucks who are making the movie, we're
gonna make 'em eat our shit, then
shit our shit, then eat their shit
which is made of our shit that we
made 'em eat. Then all you
motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay
and Silent Bob.

Silent Bob finishes typing and presses ""Return"". He and Jay
nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking
up at the menu board.

JAY
That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat
our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get
back on the road, get to Hollywood,
and stop that fucking movie from
getting made. No more hairy-bush
nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye
on the prize, and not let nothing--
and I mean NOTHING--distract me.

As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and
freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all
in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in
the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.

She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.

Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then
at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's
eyes, getting zero response.

JAY'S POV

The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to
her breasts, then down to her crotch.

Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle
of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss
on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager
to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous
with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.

But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to
Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls
his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it
over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She
smiles at the zombified Jay.

GIRL
(off cup)
Oh my God. Do you get free refills
with that?

JAY
Oh, what--this? I just wear this for
protection. You know--so no guys try
to grab my shit.

GIRL
Hi. I'm Justice.

JAY
(dreamily)
And I am so fucking yours--

Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.

JAY
I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my
hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.

JUSTICE
It's nice to meet you.

JAY
Justice, hunh? That's a nice name.
(under his breath, to
Bob)
Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-
U-C-K-I-N-G--
(back to Justice)
So you come here often?

JUSTICE
Oh, I'm not from around here. My
friends and I are taking a road trip,
and we just stopped to grab something
to eat.

JAY
Your friends, hunh? Where they at?

JUSTICE
(pointing)
Out there. By that van.

Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other
gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair
around, looking incredibly sexy.

Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--

JAY
Dude--I think I just filled the cup.

INT. VAN--DAY

Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the
other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food
to her friends.

JAY
Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent
Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!

SISSY
Who the fuck are these guys?

JUSTICE
This is Jay and Silent Bob.
(to Jay and Bob)
Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and
Chrissy.

CHRISSY
Where the fuck did they come from?

JUSTICE
I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch
a ride.

SISSY
I don't know if that's such a great
idea. Jussy.

JAY
Sure it is, Juggs.

MISSY
Oh my god--he just called Sissy
""Juggs""!

CHRISSY
I'm on it.

Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.

JUSTICE
Chrissy, no!

Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.

SISSY
We're in the middle of suburbia,
Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.

CHRISSY

}


.



And what-stupid ass little foul-
mouthed bitch-boys don't get their
balls cut off in suburbia?

JAY
(oblivious)
What's with the knife? We having
cake or something?

CHRISSY
Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.

JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Yo--she called you retarded.

SISSY
(to Justice)
What's wrong with you, Justice? You
do remember where we're going, don't
you?

MISSY
That we do have a job to do?

JUSTICE
They're just gonna tag along for a
few miles. They won't get in the
way, I promise.
(cutesy)
Please?

SISSY
Fine--they can ride with us. But
they're so out of here before we get
to Boulder.

JUSTICE
Honest Injun.

CHRISSY
""Honest Injun""?
(to Sissy)
I can't believe what a pushover you
are.

JAY
And I can't believe fine-ass bitches
like yourselves eat that shit. Don't
you know fast food makes girls fart?

Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting
into the van.

BRENT
Say--what's all this talk about
farting?

Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to
sweet and airy, totally switching characters.

SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY
Hi Brent!

SISSY
This is Brent. He's with us, too.

CHRISSY
Brent, tell these sillies that girls
don't fart.

BRENT
Of course they don't! Only skeevy
stoners fart.

The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay
and Silent Bob.

BRENT
What up, homies?
(off the Girls)
Wow, Three guys, four girls--
(to Jay and Bob)
What's the count boys?

Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.

INT. VAN--DAY

Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and
Bob listen, rolling eyes.

BRENT
Hey there mister science-guy. Don't
spray that aerosol in my eye. For I
don't really want to die. I'm a noble
rabbit!

JAY
What're you guys, like a cover band
or something?

SISSY
We're the Kansas State chapter of
S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal
Cruelty.

CHRISSY
And we're on our way to Colorado to
give Provasik a piece of our minds!

Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.

JAY
What the fuck are you bitches babbling
about?

BRENT
Hey! Watch the language little boy.
There are females present.

Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts
them.

JUSTICE
Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical
lab where they perform gross
experiments on animals.

JAY
So, what kind of animals are we
talking about here--like bears and
rhinos?

BRENT
No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...
heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak
for them, who will?
(touches Justice's
arm)
Right, Jussy?

Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After
a beat, he relaxes.

JAY
Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you
over here for a second?

Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him
confidentially.

JAY
Be honest, yo--you're down with this
for the fine-ass pussy, right?

BRENT
I'm down with this because I love
animals, stupid.

JAY
Even sheep?

BRENT
Of course. Sheep are beautiful
creatures.

JAY
They are beautiful, aren't they?

BRENT
Oh God, yes.

JAY
So then you'd fuck a sheep?

BRENT
What is your damage little boy? You've
got a sick and twisted world
perspective.

JAY
No, you misunderstand me, Prince
Valiant. I mean if you were another
sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if
you were another sheep?

BRENT
I--suppose so.

JAY
That's what I thought.
(suddenly loudly, to
all)
YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF
US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled
out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as
well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.

JAY
YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!

EXT. HIGHWAY--LATER

The van drives down the road.

INT. VAN--SAME

Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels
between them.

CHRISSY
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

SISSY
Shut up, I'm thinking.

In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her,
and she quickly folds them up.

JAY
Is Hollywood near where we're going?

JUSTICE
Is that where you guys are from?

JAY
Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!

JUSTICE
Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you
all the way out here?

JAY
Well, we couldn't hang in front of
the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of
the strainen-en order, which sucks
ass 'cause it's been like our home
since we were kids. Silent Bob even
busted his cherry there.

JUSTICE
(to Bob)
You did? I'll bet she was a lucky
girl.

Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has
strayed.

JAY
Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying
to tell a story here.

JUSTICE
Sorry.

JAY
Anyway, we were talking to Brodie
and he said there's gonna be a
Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we
went to see Holden McNeil, and he
showed us the Internet, and that's
where we found all these fucking
little jerkoffs were saying shit
about us. So we decided to go to
Hollywood and stop the movie from
getting made.  And now we're here.

JUSTICE
Wow. I have no idea what you just
said.

JAY
Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like
animals, huh?

JUSTICE
Sure.

JAY
That's cool. Even snakes?

JUSTICE
You can't exclude an animal just
because it's not cuddly. Of course I
like snakes.

JAY
How about trouser snakes?

JUSTICE
What's a trouser snake?

Just then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.

JAY DEVIL
(to Jay)
What the fuck are you waiting for?
She went for the setup! Reach in
your fucking pants, and pull yer
cock out, bitch! That's the kinda
shit girls like!

Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right
shoulder.

JAY DEVIL 2
Right about here's where the angel's
supposed to show up and tell you not
to pull your dick out. But we bitch-
slapped that little fuck and sent
him packing, so it's smooth sailing.
Let 'er rip, boy!

They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his
hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick,
when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder,
rubbing a swollen jaw.

JAY ANGEL
Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal
here?
(looks down)
Oh, shit--you're not thinking of
whipping your dick out at this fine
piece of woman, are you?

Jay thinks, then nods ""Yes."" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes,
and slaps him.

JAY ANGEL
Tell you what: look at Silent Bob.
See if he thinks it's a good idea to
whip your dick out.

Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in
his pants to Jay and shakes his head ""no,"" sternly. Jay
withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods,
satisfied.

JAY ANGEL
That's it, boy--put the dick down.
You gotta go from the heart, yo. No
little perv bullshit will do for
this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de
la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the
shit out of two suckerpunching little
bitches. Remember--don't pull your
dick out until she asks you to.
(beat)
Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!
The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice
looks at Jay, a bit confused.

JAY
Don't ask.
(beat)
So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like
me do to help the animals?

JUSTICE
You really don't want to help us--

JAY
What the fuck are you talking about?
Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

Justice smiles. Jay tries to recover.

JAY
I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything
for youse guys. For the lift and
shit.

JUSTICE
You sure?

JAY
Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.
Fuck

JUSTICE
Well--okay. Let me talk it over with
the other girls and get back to you.

JAY
You do that.

Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.

JAY
I'll be right here.

He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the
can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and
winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly,
then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.

JAY
Fuck you. Fatty.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY

The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls
head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent
Bob.

JUSTICE
You guys want anything from inside?

JAY
No, we're cool, thanks hon.

Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study
the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a
place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.
After a beat--

JAY
It just ain't the same, is it? This
place licks balls compared to Quick
Stop.

Silent Bob shakes his head ""Yeah.""

JAY
And speaking of licking balls--how
'bout that Justice chick? She is too
fine.  And she smells so fucking
pretty. She's got a nice voice, too.
And that body?  Smoking. You know,
she never once said ""fuck off,"" when
I was talking to her, or pulled out
the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell
ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded
by the other girls.

MISSY
Smooth move, Justice.

CHRISSY
(slapping Justice
upside the head)
Nice going, Four Eyes!

JUSTICE
Ow!

SISSY
Why the fuck did you let that little
stoner throw Brent our of the van?!

JUSTICE
Oh please--if I had to listen to one
more of those stupid songs, I was
going to throw him out myself.

SISSY
We needed Brent, Justice! He was our
patsy!

JUSTICE
We'll find someone else. Besides, I
didn't see you trying to stop Jay
from throwing him out.

SISSY
Because I didn't want to blow our
cover!

JUSTICE
Cover, shmover--you all hated his
songs, too.

CHRISSY
Not as much as I hate you.

Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance,

CHRISSY
Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone
soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!

SISSY
(rubbing Chrissy's
shoulders)
Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a
little too wound for sound.

CHRISSY
Then how about you help me take the
edge off?

Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot
and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other
customers regard them wide-eyed.

JUSTICE
(to Customers)
They're really good friends.

SISSY
(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)
Would you two knock it off? We're in
the fucking heartland here! Try to
blend!

JUSTICE
They already do--she's the milkmaid,
and she's the cow.

CHRISSY
Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,
bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your
head off and fuck your spine stump.

SISSY
Enough!
(calm to Justice)
We have a very simple gang here,
Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's
the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl.
But lately, I'm having a hard time
figuring out what you're doing here.

JUSTICE
That makes two of us.

CHRISSY
Shit--your name doesn't even fit the
rhyme scheme.

JUSTICE
That's because very few names rhyme
with ""douchebag.""

CHRISSY
(getting in her face)
You're dancing on my last nerve,
Strawberry Shortcake.
(to Sissy)
You deal with the weak link. I'm
gonna take Missy into the dirty
convenience store bathroom and hate-
fuck the shit out of her.

Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.

JUSTICE
And you said letting them read all
that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to
anything.

SISSY
Don't change the subject. You know
what you have to do now, right? Since
you let our patsy slip away, you've
gotta convince the little kid and
that fat guy to take his place.
They've gotta break into Provasik
now.

JUSTICE
Uh-uh!

SISSY
Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out
of this gang. Just use the little
one's crush to convince him, since
he's so fucking in love with you.

JUSTICE
Jay? No he's not.

SISSY
What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing
your hand back in the van like he
was fucking Lord Byron?

JUSTICE
Well, maybe he was just raised with
manners.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.

JAY
(to exited Girl)
YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE
LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!
(to Bob)
Yeah.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

Sissy continues to confront Justice.

SISSY
You're the one that brought the kid
in, Jussy. So you've gotta make
amends.

JUSTICE
Jay is not taking Brent's place as
the patsy.

SISSY
That kid and his quite friend are
our only options at this point. Now
we got about two hours before we get
to Boulder. That gives you plenty of
of time to work on him.

JUSTICE
I'm not gonna do it.

SISSY
Why the fuck not?

JUSTICE
Because he's just to so innocent!

Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing
alongside Bob.

JUSTICE
Look at him--

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to
Silent Bob.

JAY
I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little
asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my
balls--in her mouth! Where? Where?
In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her
mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls--

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.

SISSY
Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or
us?

Justice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks
back out at Jay.

INT. VAN--DAY

Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.

JAY
Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.

JUSTICE
It's not really stealing--it's
liberating it, and--
(finally hears him)
Wait a second--did you say, ""No
problem""?

JAY
Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the
time.
(to Bob)
Right, Lunchbox?

Silent Bob glares at Jay.

JUSTICE
It's not like it's a bad thing. It's
for a good cause.

JAY
Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--
(takes her hand)
The cause of love.
(kisses her hand,
then releases)
Snoogans--

JUSTICE
What the heck is that?

JAY
What's what?

JUSTICE
""Snoogans,"" I believe it was.

JAY
What the fuck do you think it means?
It means ""I'm kidding.""

JUSTICE
Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.

She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front
of the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then
humps silent Bob's leg like a dog.

JAY
(singing)
I can't believe I'm gonna get some
pussy for stealing a monkey!
(speaking)
If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've
been stealing monkeys since I was
like seven and shit.

Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.

JAY
Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin
this for me. Me and Justice are gonna
get married one day, so don't be
giving me that ""we-ain't-stealing-no-
monkey"" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're
Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that.
That girl? That girl's in love with
me.

Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.

JUSTICE
They're gonna do it.

SISSY
Good. They do their part--
(pats a video camera)
And we'll do ours.

Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs,
parking in front of another large building.

INT. VAN--SAME

Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear
Ninja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.

JUSTICE
Remember--we meet back here when
you're done. You sure you're okay
with this?

JAY
As sure as I am that you're the
hottest bitch I ever seen.

Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy
away.

JAY
What's twisting that bitch's tits?

JUSTICE
Maybe it's because women don't like
to be called ""bitches,"" Jay.

JAY
They don't? Well how 'bout ""piece of
ass""?

JUSTICE
How about not.

JAY
Well, what the fuck am I supposed to
call you, then?

JUSTICE
Something sweet, you big goof.
Something nice.

JAY
(thinks; then)
Boo-boo kitty fuck.

JUSTICE
(laughing)
Okay.  That's a start.

Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming
it at Jay and Bob.

SISSY
Jay, before you go, could you say
something into the camera about the
clitoris.

JAY
What?

JUSTICE
(to Sissy)
Man you are such a bitch--

SISSY
(off Justice; to Jay)
She's just a little embarrassed.
See, Jussy and I are putting together
this documentary for our Human
Sexuality class, and we need a male
perspective on the clitoris.

JAY
The female clitoris?

SISSY
Uh--yeah.

JUSTICE
Jay, you don't have to do this.

She elbows Sissy.

JAY
Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few
things I can say about the clit that
I's like you to hear.
(clears throat; into
camera)
I am the master of the clit! I make
that shit work! It does what ever
the fuck I tell it to do!  No one
rules the clit like me!
(off Silent Bob)
Not this little fuck! None of you
little fucks out there! I am the
clit commander!!! Remember that--
commander of all clits!

Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes
her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.

SISSY
Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.

Sissy climbs back into the van.

JAY
(to Justice)
So--can I get a little kiss for good
luck?

Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.

JAY
So--can I get a little blow job for
good luck?

Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off,
revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in
midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out.
Justice watches them go.

SISSY
Jussy. C'mon.

Justice climbs back into the van.

INT. VAN--SAME

Justice sits, glaring at Sissy.

SISSY
Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my
authority again, you lose your fucking
fronts, you got that?

JUSTICE
Yes, sir.

Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to
Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment.

SISSY
Phase One, down. While we're executing
Phase Two, you edit that tape and
grab a new car.

MISSY
No sweat.

SISSY
Let's suit up.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,
stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN
out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly
gives the ""metal"" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.

INT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

It's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a
window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja
hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.

JAY
You fat fuck--

INT. VAN--NIGHT

Missy peers through binoculars out the window.

SISSY
They in?

MISSY
You can say that.

SISSY
Time to shine. Let's go.

EXT. VAN--NIGHT

The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look
at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black.
They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front
door.

Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures
elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers
Sissy a look.

JUSTICE
You are so gay.

Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a
digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four
different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.

SISSY
Once we're inside, I want complete
silence.
(holding up high-tech
device)
Missy whipped this up. It counts our
decibel level. If it goes into the
red--alarm, we're dead. So not even
the slightest noise, got it?

Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed
closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one
last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay
and Bob.

SISSY
(pokes her head back
out)
Justice! Move your ass!

Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads:
BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.

INT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT

Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.

It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking
ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his
eyes and hits him.

JAY
Stay frosty, you big fucking softie.
We've got a job to do.

Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade
through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on
the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.

JAY
Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal
tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up
like Percocets!

Jay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and
tosses it to Bob.

JAY
Hold this. Later, me and Justice can
shoot each other with it and fuck
like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.

Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The
pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND
OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage
from where the sound emitted. He smiles.

JAY
(reading)
""Suzanne."" Boo-yah.

INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the
other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.

Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays
the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor,
which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly,
within the mist, laser beams become apparent.

Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few
steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs
forward and does an impressive series of flips down the
hallway, not touching a single laser beam.

Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of
the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture
to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series
of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.

Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to
Chrissy.

Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,
Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.

Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are
even more impressive than the other two, including running
up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes
the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice,
arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud,
manly FART.

The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING
through the building.

CHRISSY
Holy fuck--the little stoner was
right--

Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours
them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed
by Justice and Chrissy.

EXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy
pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.

CHRISSY
Boom Box!

Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races
toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the
convertible.

SISSY
I can't believe it. Months of planning
and it's all blown by a fucking fart.

JUSTICE
We can't just leave them like this!
That alarm's gonna bring the cops
here any minute!

SISSY
That was always the plan, Justice!
They take the heat off of is long
enough until we can get out of town!

Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.

CHRISSY
Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.

The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into
the car with them.

CHRISSY
It's set. Let's roll.

The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there.
The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting
down from two minutes.

INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT

Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something
seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent
bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the
cages. Jay hits him.

JAY
What the fuck are you looking at?
There ain't no snacks here, man! Now
we got what we came for, so let's
get the fuck out!

Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes
his head frustrated.

JAY
Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck
are we supposed to do about it?

Silent bob offers Jay a look.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob
(carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs,
birds, rabbits. All race off into the night.

Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.

JUSTICE
JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!

Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.

JAY
Oh shit--

Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and
Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay
looks to Bob, pissed

COP
DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS
EXPLOSIVE!

The counter on the device attached to the van hits ""0,"" and
the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one
direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks
at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.

JAY
Justice--

We crane up from him as he bellows--

JAY
JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!

Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still
carrying the bag.

EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife
Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY
opening the door and heading inside.

INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an
operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go
wide.

DEPUTY
Oh, fudge...
(calling off)
Marshal Willenholly!

INT. BATHROOM--SAME

MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged
Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks
off.

WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby--
It takes two hands to hold doesn't
it--?  Uhhh--

As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.

WILLENHOLLY
WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!

DEPUTY (O.S.)
Sir, we got a report of a break-in
at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing
lab.

Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine.
There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.

WILLENHOLLY
Have you read this article on the
mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I
wish that was in our jurisdiction--
I'd shut down every last one of those
ass-cock chuggers, personally.

The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then
at Willenholly.

WILLENHOLLY
What? ""Ass"" means ""donkey.""

DEPUTY
Yes, sir.
(hands him a fax)

WILLENHOLLY
(looks at fax)
Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.

DEPUTY
We don't have a jet, sir. And
Boulder's only ten minutes away.

WILLENHOLLY
Then gas up the next best thing.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY

There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out
van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly
pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.

WILLENHOLLY
My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats
out?
(thinks)
Wait--is that right?

COP 1 (O.S.)
Excuse me--who the hell are you?

Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket,
revealing a badge.

WILLENHOLLY
Federal Wildlife Marshal. This
investigation is now under my
jurisdiction.

COP 1
Oh really? And why is that?

WILLENHOLLY
Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.

COP 1
Well, we believe that was just a
diversionary tactic used to call
attention away from the real heist
over here at the Diamond Exchange.

WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, right. That's a believable
scenario. It sounds more like
something out of a bad movie.

Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another
COP joins them.

COP 2
Sir, the Provasik people say they've
rounded all their animals up, except
for one: an orangutan.

WILLENHOLLY
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our
fugitive has been on the run for 6
hours!  Average simian foot speed
over uneven ground--barring injuries
or preoccupation with tire tubes,
mites or bananas--is four miles an
hour. That gives us a radius of twenty
miles.

COP 3
(calling out from
crowd)
Twenty-four, sir!

WILLENHOLLY
What?

COP 3
Six hours times four miles an hour
is twenty-four.

WILLENHOLLY
(doing the math in
his head)
Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-
four miles. Now what I want out of
all of you is a hard target search.

COP 4
Excuse me, sir?

WILLENHOLLY
Yeah?

COP 4
What does that mean, exactly--a ""hard
target search""? What's a ""hard
target""?

WILLENHOLLY
Well. It's--a target--that's--hard.
Anyway--

COP 4
So are you referring to the search's
level of difficulty? Or is the hard
target the monkey?

COP 3
Or the people who stole the monkey?

The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of
""Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,""etc.
Willenholly rubs his temples.

WILLENHOLLY
Okay, how about this? What I want
out of all of you is a thorough search
of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse, and doghouse in that area!
Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!

COP 1
Wouldn't it make sense to put them
up at every twenty-four miles--seeing
as that's how far they'd have gotten
in the last six hours?

They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly
looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.

WILLENHOLLY
This is so frustrating. It's just so
hard sometimes--
(yelling)
YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO
FIND HER!

Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.

COP 5
Sir, this was just delivered to the
station.

WILLENHOLLY
What is it?

COP 5
It's a tape from the terrorists who're
claiming credit for the break-in.

WILLENHOLLY
Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--
never mind. Do you have a VCR?

INT. OFFICE--DAY

Willenholly and the Cops stare at the O.C. TV, shocked, as
the video ends.

WILLENHOLLY
Oh my God--
(without looking up)
Have the jet gassed up and ready to
go at a moment's notice.

COP
Sir, we don't have a jet; just a
helicopter.

WILLENHOLLY
(dialing his cell
phone)
Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore?
(into cell phone)
Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta
get me on the national news, pronto.
Why?!  Because we may very well be
dealing with the two most dangerous
men on the planet!

EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at--

SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them,
staring back.

JAY
This is Jussy's monkey
(to Suzanne, angrily)
JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY
FUCK!

Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and
Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and
pulling back as if he's going to strike.

JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Do something. Tons of Fun!

Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her
hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to
see over silent Bob.

JAY
Is that fucking thing waving at us?

Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at
the ape.

JAY
Holy shit? That monkey understood
us! Maybe it's some sort of super-
monkey!

Suzanne offer them a ""raspberry."" Spitting as if the comment
was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at
this.

JAY
What the fuck was that for? It's not
a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?

Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, ""Congo stunk."" Silent
Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him,
stung.

JAY
You're my bitch. You get my back.
Don't go joining this chimp's side.

Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent
Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.

JAY
Yo--what if there's more super monkeys
up in the lab? Maybe they're making
an army of 'em up there! Holy shit!
Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the
X-Files Roswell--style!

JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--

INT. LAB--DAY

We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids
in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching
blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes
hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which
looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.

JAY (V.O.)
Working in secret with a crew of
double-dealing, nicotine-fiending
fucks that're selling out the human
race, these supermonkeys will use
simian science and their genius IQ's
to make man and monkey alike believe
that they're the superior species!

EXT. BALCONY--DAY

A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of
apes, who wave fists in the air.

JAY (V.O.)
Then all it'll take is one little
monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the
dumber chimps into a frenzy, until
they go all ape-shit and start
demanding more bananas, better pay,
and human flesh!

EXT. FIELD--DAY

Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield,
and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA
on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net
over him.

JAY (V.O.)
You'll have to be faster than Walt
Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior
gorillas, who hunt humans for sport,
profit, and the occasional inter-
species blow-job. And if you don't
wind up with a monkey hog in your
mouth, you'll be captured, killed or
worse...

INT. LAB--DAY

Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a
living, screaming, Dante.

JAY (V.O.)
Eaten alive!

EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like
atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of
bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop

JAY (V.O.)
Then these monkey fucks'll start
wearing our clothes and rebuilding
the world in their image.

EXT. BEACH--DAY

We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up,
then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach
buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.

JAY (V.O.)
And only those who outwit those damn
dirty apes'll ever remember that it
was MAN who once ruled the earth!

JAY
(at statue)
YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN
YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!

WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:

EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne
and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne
angrily.

JAY
Not on my watch, motherfucker!

Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.

JAY
DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!

Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the
dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers,
and kisses him on the lips.

JAY
Alright--you can live. For now.

Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.

JAY
You see that? Bitches love me.
(heading off)
Besides--we're in the fucking clear,
yo. It's not like anyone knows we
stole the monkey.

INT. TV NEWS STATION--DAY

An ANCHORMAN addresses the camera.

ANCHORMAN
I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News
Now bulletin. A Provasik animal
testing facility in boulder was the
focus of an attack by a terroristic
primate rescue syndicate calling
themselves the Coalition for
Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers.
Or simply, C.L.I.T.

A graphic of the C.L.I.T. logo appears beside him, nailing
home the joke.

ANCHORMAN
In a videotape sent to authorities
this morning, credit for the
liberation of an orangutan from the
lab last night is taken by these men--

A VIDEO CAPTURE of JAY and SILENT BOB from pre-break--in
appears on screen.

ANCHORMAN
--identified in literature that
accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent
Bob. In this chilling clip, they
make it very clear that they are in
control of the C.L.I.T.

On screen is the C.L.I.T. Logo. A digitized voice narrates.

DIGITIZED VOICE
We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are
safe. Now tremble before the might
of our merciless leader.

The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy
shot before the Provasik break-in. Jay's yelling into the
camera.

JAY
I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!

Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his
head, chilled.

ANCHORMAN
Terrifying. Here to help us understand
this footage is Federal Wildlife
Marshal Willenholly.

PULL OUT to reveal Willenholly beside the Anchorman.

ANCHORMAN
Marshal, what can you tell us about
the C.L.I.T.?

WILLENHOLLY
From the intelligence we've been
able to gather, we've discovered
that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot
of the L.A.B.I.A.

ANCHORMAN
The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning
Apes movement.

WILLENHOLLY
Exactly. The men you saw in the video
are believed to be the masterminds
responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T.
activity last night. They go by the
obvious code names ""Jay"" and ""Silent
Bob.""
(to camera)
If you should come across them or
any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please--
exercise extreme caution.

INT. POTZEK'S INC. OFFICE--NIGHT

On the TV screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay
and Silent Bob.  Holden looks up from his drawing table,
shocked.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
(from TV)
Marshal, how do you respond to
allegations that Federal Wildlife
Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T.
to slip through their fingers?

WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T.,
Reg.

HOLDEN
(shakes his head)
Nights like this, I miss dating a
lesbian.

INT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT

From behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV,
slack-jawed.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
(from TV)
Is there also speculation that Jay
and Silent bob may be responsible
for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist
that occurred in the same vicinity
of downtown Boulder last night?

WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
There's nothing to suggest that, no.
But these men are still to be
considered very dangerous.

RANDAL
(to Dante)
I told you that restraining order
was a good idea.

EXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME

On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel,
Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink
champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans
against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report
on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.

ANCHORMAN
(on TV)
Is that your cell phone?

WILLENHOLLY
(on TV)
Yes, Excuse me.
(on TV, into cell
phone)
Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my
way!
(shuts phone; to
anchorman)
We got 'em. They're in Utah.
(to camera)
Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the
C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T.
is not recommended.

Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.

JUSTICE
Your tape worked. The news is all
about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik
break-in, with almost no mention of
the Diamond heist.

SISSY
(yelling down to
Justice)
I told you those two were the perfect
patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--
just in case--and start planning the
next job.

JUSTICE
Don't you feel any regret? Jay and
Bob don't deserve this. They were
really sweet.

CHRISSY
The only thing I regret is not gutting
that little trout-mouthed prick like
a fish and playing Twister with his
vitals.

MISSY
You are so nasty.

CHRISSY
I'll show you nasty, you little slut.

SISSY
Would you two get a room?

CHRISSY
Fine--we'll take yours.
(getting up in Sissy's
face)
I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-
otch.

Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls
her eyes.

SISSY
Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.

JUSTICE
They're your gang.

SISSY
Oh and not yours? You know, I don't
get you, Justice. You used to be all
about the girl stuff: stealing,
boning, blowing shit up. Now you're
like this little priss with a
conscience. It's really a fucking
drag.

JUSTICE
We all gotta grow up some time.

SISSY
If moping around over some little
boy you're crushing on is being grown-
up, then pass me my Wonder Woman
underoos.

JUSTICE
Don't you feel the least bit of guilt
for what we did to those guys?

SISSY
Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty
about setting up her boyfriend? Then
how about taking a shower?

Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace.
They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY
GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
You the gals that ordered the pizzas?

SISSY
This dopey bitch ordered the large
plain, but I could go for some hot,
thick, Sicilian.

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
No charge, lady.  He rushes into the
motel, Justice sighs, looking up at
the stars.

JUSTICE
(quietly)
I'm sorry, Jay.

INT. DINER--DAY

Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay
chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne
digs into a banana split.

JAY
You know, Justice died trying to
save this monkey, so maybe we should
keep her around. That way, we can
honor her memory.

Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their
food.

JAY
Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing
all sentimental, and you're all about
a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't
you glad we stopped to eat?  And you
were all piss-scared the cops'd bust
us or something. You know what I
say?
(singing, a la NWA)

VOICE (O.S.)
(via bullhorn)
THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE
KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER
THE ORANGUTAN!

Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then--

JAY
You think they're talking to us?

EXT. DINER--DAY

There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling
at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other
COPS.

SHERIFF
YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.
(to other COPS)
Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.

Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind
the car, gun drawn.

SHERIFF
The ape.

WILLENHOLLY
What?

SHERIFF
An orangutan's a member of the great
ape family. It's not a monkey.

WILLENHOLLY
Look, who's the Federal Wildlife
Marshal here?
(into bullhorn)
JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL
WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR
C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.
SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY,
AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!

INT. DINER--DAY

Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth,
like scared rats.

JAY
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Go out there and give 'em the monkey.

Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked.

JAY
Oh, what, man? I said that shit before
I knew they were gonna shoot us!
Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't
takin' no bullet for no monkey!

Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay
rolls his eyes.

JAY
Oh, brother--this is like something
out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe
it's not that bad back at the lab!
Maybe they experiment on 'em by,
like making 'em fuck a bunch of
different, good-looking monkeys. We
don't know! Maybe they got it real
sweet!

Suzanne shakes her head ""no."" Bob points to her, as if she's
strengthening his point.

JAY
(to Suzanne)
You stay out of this, you weepy little
chimp!
(looks around thinking)
Fuck man, I ain't no strategist!
You're the guy that makes the
blueprints! I don't even have the
fucking smarts of a little--

Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's
a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded
sweatshirt and a baseball cap.

EXT. DINER--DAY

Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The
Sheriff looks on.

WILLENHOLLY
ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY
BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO
OPEN FIRE!
(to cops)
Everyone has bullets in their guns,
right?

Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between
them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed
up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the
diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.
It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.

JAY
Don't shoot! We're just trying to
take our son out of this hostile
environment!

From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.

SHERIFF
Their ""son""?

WILLENHOLLY
Maybe they're one of those gay
couples?

Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.

JAY
Yeah! We're gay! And this is our
adopted love child! We're not from
around here!  Don't make us go back
to our liberal city home with a tales
of prejudice and bigotry in the heart
of Utah!
(whispers to Bob)
You see the shit I gotta put up with
for you! Now I got this guy thinking
I'm gay!

WILLENHOLLY
Oh God, this is the last thing I
need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals
shooting their mouth off in the
liberal press that the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes
gays.

SHERIFF
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY
BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON!
THAT'S THE APE!

WILLENHOLLY
You see this badge?  I think I'd
recognize an ape if I saw one. And
the only thing I do recognize here
is a political fiasco I'm, going to
avoid by letting this butt-fucking
Brady Bunch go!

Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--

JAY
And I'll tell you another thing:
what if that guy shows up around the
stores one day and starts telling
everybody you and me are poo-gilists?
How are we gonna get any pussy then,
hunh?

WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)
YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!

Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look
back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at
himself, as if to say, ""Me?""

WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
YES, YOU, SIRS.

JAY
(calling over)
So we can just go?

WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my
apologies for detaining you and your
unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
protected-family unit.

SHERIFF
(amazed)
Un-fucking believable.

JAY
I'd like to offer a big gay thank-
you, sir. We'll tell all our gay
friends that Utah is Gay friendly
country for gays who are gay.

WILLENHOLLY
I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You
might also want to make it clear
that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's
Office is also pro-'mo as well.
(winks at the sheriff)
And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.

JAY
Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm.
See, I knocked up a hot woman friend
of ours who I also fuck on the side.
So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But
my tubby husband here is one hundred
percent queer. He loves the cock.

WILLENHOLLY
He certainly looks insatiable.

JAY
'Bye

WILLENHOLLY
'Bye

Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road.
Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.

WILLENHOLLY
Well, it's not my way--but damned if
there doesn't go one happy family.
(balloon two)
Now, we just shoot some tear gas
into that diner, and when the two
guys run out with the monkey, we'll--

Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the
Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY
That was the them, wasn't it?

EXT. ROAD--DAY

Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.

JAY
I said you ""love the cock""! I gotta
be the craftiest motherfucker alive!

GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now
in full panic mode.

Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.

Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.

JAY
FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't),
shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at
it, screaming.

JAY
HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!

Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all
around them, Jay leaps into the manhole.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL

Jay lands in a sewer tunnel (like in The Fugitive). Suzanne
lands on top of him.

JAY
Take your stinking paws off me, you
damn dirty ape!
(yelling up)
YO LUNCHBOX! HURRY UP!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives
into the sewer grate as well, but--

INT. SEWER TUNNEL

Silent Bob gets stuck. Jay rolls his eyes.

JAY
You fat fuck.

Silent Bob struggles while Jay and Suzanne try to pull him
through the hole.

JAY
You just--had to--order pancakes--
didn't ya?

EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

CLOSER on the running Willenholly and Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY
Fire a warning shot into that bulbous
ass!

SHERIFF
One rectal breach, coming up!

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

Jay and Suzanne pull with all their might. Bob strains.

JAY
SUCK IT IN! THINK THIN! THINK THIN!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

TIGHT on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim.

SHERIFF
Open up and say ""ahhhhh,"" you stoner
sumbitch--

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

TIGHT on Silent Bob bellowing.

SILENT BOB
AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

The Sheriff's gun fires.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

Jay and Suzanne fall backwards, as Silent Bob pops through.

JAY
INCOMING!!!

SILENT BOB
AAAIIIGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!

SUZANNE
OOOOOOOOO!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip
through.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne are in various states of
collapse. Jay and Bob look up at the hole.

JAY
Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole.

WILLENHOLLY
Wow! That was an incredibly daring
escape!
(to Sheriff)
You must see that a lot, hunh?

SHERIFF
Shut up!

WILLENHOLLY
Sire, you're very taciturn.

Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff
looks on.

WILLENHOLLY
You and your men stay up here. When
I corner them, I'll call you for
back-up.

SHERIFF
What're you doing? They're trapped.
The only way they can get out of
there is right here.

WILLENHOLLY
A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't
wait for his prey to come to him. He
comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it
""comes to it"" or ""goes to it""?
(shakes it off)
I'm going in there. I'm counting on
you Sheriff.

Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY
You've taught me so much.

Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The
Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--

SHERIFF
Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to
the station and get some donuts.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

TIGHT on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance,
bathed by natural light. We HEAR the loud sounds of water
rushing.

JAY
This reminds me of the night I fucked
your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly,
gaping hole, and me wishing I had a
board tied to my ass--

PULL BACK to reveal Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne standing at
the precipice of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a DAM.
Water rushed below.

JAY
--to keep from falling in.

WILLENHOLLY
PUT THE MONKEY DOWN AND YOUR HANDS
UP!

Willenholly aims his gun at the trio's backs.

WILLENHOLLY
MISTERS, DO YOU WANNA GET SHOT?!?

Our heroes comply, but Jay speaks.

JAY
LOOK MAN--SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO
BACK! THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING ON HER!
(beat)
AND FOR THE RECORD, I AIN'T REALLY
GAY!

WILLENHOLLY
I DON'T CARE!
(beat)
AND FOR THE RECORD, I KNEW THAT WASN'T
REALLY A LITTLE BOY.

JAY
SURE, FOR ONE MORE RECORD--
(pointing to Silent
Bob)
HE LOVES COCK!

WILLENHOLLY
ON YOUR KNEES!

Jay and Silent Bob face Willenholly and kneel. But Suzanne's
still looking out of the dam.

JAY
See, man?! He's lining us up like
fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going
first--I don't want no mouthful of
monkey-spit when I gotta blow this
fucking G-Man.

TIGHT on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water
below. Her brow hardens with purpose.

TIGHT on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand.

TIGHT on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand.

Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob
backwards.

JAY
GET OFFA ME!!! GET OFFA ME!!!

EXT. DAM--DAY

Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and
Bob with her.

JAY AND BOB
AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

Willenholly goes wide-eyed, holstering his gun.

WILLENHOLLY
Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter
Pan on me?!

He races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as
well.

WILLENHOLLY
AAAIIIGGGGHHHHH!!!

EXT. DAM--DAY

As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her
feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the
tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent
Bob's hands.

JAY
HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--
SMOKER!!!

EXT. DAM BOTTOM--DAY

Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes
into the drink.

EXT. DAM--DAY

Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of
the tunnel.

JAY
You see that shit? Damn--remind me
not to get on the monkey's bad side.
Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so
we can get the fuck out of here.

Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the--

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

--pavement near the manhole. She sits there, looking down.

EXT. DAM--DAY

Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the
road,

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the
shot.

Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway
just in time to see--

The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates
and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is
looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to
their feet, chasing after the truck.

JAY
HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!

The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob
stand there, panting.

JAY
Man! Who the fuck just steals a
monkey?!

Silent Bob indicates themselves.

JAY
Oh yeah.
(pissed)
Well this fucking blows! We got one
more day to stop those fucks from
making that movie, and someone goes
and takes the only thing I had left
from the one woman I ever loved enough
NOT to try to stick my hand down her
pants!

Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.

JAY
Go after the monkey? How the fuck
are we supposed to know where that
thing's going?

Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares
at him.

JAY
What? What is that supposed to mean?!
Don't just fucking point like--
(imitates him)
You ain't the broad in the Children
of a Lesser God. Use you fucking
mouth for more than eating, ya tubby
bitch!

Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what
he's saying.

JAY
You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta
take a salad? Take a salad? What the
fuck are you trying to say?

Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message.

JAY
JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?

Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face.

SILENT BOB
THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID
CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB
FUCK!!!

Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the
direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat,
then follows, muttering under his breath--

JAY
Say it, don't spray it, bitch.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT.

SHERIFF (O.S.)
""And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.""

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY

The Sheriff and his men stand around, eating donuts, laughing.
The Station doors slam open, and Willenholly enters, soaking
wet. All the Cops stare at him.

SHERIFF
Well, if it isn't the wildlife
experts. Did you come to it or go to
it?

WILLENHOLLY
Do you have a microwave here, Sheriff?

SHERIFF
We have a toaster oven. Why?

WILLENHOLLY
Because I need to dry my gun out so
I can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE!

SHERIFF
This might cheer you up.
(hands him paper)
Your office just faxed this over.
Guy there say it's a post from an
Internet chat board, signed by a
""Jay and Silent Bob."" Your man thinks
it's a lead as to where those fellas
are taking the ape.

WILLENHOLLY
(reading)
""All you motherfuckers are gonna
pay. You are the ones who are ball-
lickers.  We're gonna fuck your
mothers while you watch and cry like
little bitches. Once we get to
Hollywood--""
(looks up)
They're going to Hollywood.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD--MONTAGE

We take a quick visual tour of the city, including the sign,
the line of front of Krispy Kreme, the line in front of Coffee
Bean and Tea Leaf, the Simpson star in the Walk- of- Fame,
the Rocky and Bullwinkle statue, the Beverly Center, Jerry's
Famous Deli, the Hollywood and Vine sign, Mann's Chinese
Theatre, the Star Wars footprints outside of Mann's, the
Chateau Marmont, people on cell phones, Trashy Lingerie.
HOOKERS propositioning a potential JOHN, and finally--

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD--DAY

We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER
that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with
Silent Bob sitting in the back seat.  After a beat, Jay pops
up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around.
The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out
and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay
a look.

JAY
What? It's not like it's cheating.
Justice blew up.

Two HOOKERS approach them.

HOOKER 1
Hey, little man. You want some of
this?

HOOKER 2
How about you, Big Boy?

HOOKER 1
If you've got fifty bucks we can get
nasty.

JAY
Oh yeah? How nasty?

HOOKER 2
As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.

JAY
Alright--first, I'll want to tongue
your bung while you juggle my balls
in one hand and play with my asshole
with the other. But don't stick you
finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky
you and put it in your friend's brown,
while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie
cup. After that, I'll wanna smell
your titties, for a while, and you
can pull my nutsack up over my dick,
so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I
want you to flick at my nuts while
your friend spanks me into the same
Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then
we throw the Dixie cup out.

The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then--

HOOKER 1
Oh, that's it honey. I quit.
(walking away)
This job just passed the point of no
return.

HOOKER 2
(to Jay)
You one fucked up puppy, poppie.

JAY
(watching them go)
What?! You said 'nasty'?
(shakes his head; to
Bob)
Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck
up.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.--LATER

Jay and Silent Bob walk.

JAY
Alright, here's the plan: first, we
find out where they're shooting that
movie at. After we shut that shit
down, we can start looking for the
monkey. But before we do any of that
shit, we gotta find a motherfucker
in the know. Someone who's like, the
mayor of Hollywood.

They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a
sale.

DEALER
(subtly)
Crack? You want some crack? Sweet-
ass rock. Get you high.

JAY
No man, but you want some weed?

DEALER
(beat)
You on the job?

JAY
(pulling out a card)
Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.

CLOSE ON THE CARD.  It reads: UNITED JERSEY BROTHERHOOD OF
DEALERS, LOCAL 408.

There's a graphic of a stoner beside it.

DEALER
I'm Los Angeles Local 305!

They shake hands, slapping each other on the back like Union
brothers.

DEALER
You guys got medical in Jersey yet?

JAY
Shit, no, we might have to strike in
September.

DEALER
Norma Rae like a motherfucker. You
gots to get your benefits, you know
what I'm saying?

JAY
I hear that. Yo--maybe you can help
us out. You know where they're
shooting a movie around here.

DEALER
You in this town and you gonna ask
that question? Be a little more
specific.

JAY
It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust
it up so people stop calling us names
on the Internet, even though they're
not really talking about us but these
characters based on us, and at the
same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who-
got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's
monkey.

Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.

DEALER
I don't know that the fuck you just
said, little kid. But you touched a
brother's heart, so I'm gonna help
you out with some directions to the
studio.

JAY
You know where Miramax is at?

DEALER
Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for
seventy-eight percent of my business.

INT. E! ENTERTAINMENT NEWS--DAY

After E! news logo plays. CUT TO STEVE KMETKO in studio.

STEVE KMETKO
Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent
Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife
Marshal's Office tells us a posting
was pulled off an Internet movie
chat board that was allegedly written
by the two domestic terrorists
themselves. It's sending a shockwave
through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on
the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules?

Jules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate.

JULES ASNER
Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is
one of terror today, after the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office learned
that hot, new terrorists Jay and
Silent Bob are targeting Miramax
Studios for their next campaign of
blood, violence and monkey-theft. In
the posting, pulled off Movie Poop
Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome
threatened, quote--
(reading)
""Once we get to Hollywood and find
those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who
are making the Bluntman and Chronic
movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our
Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive-
Deleted, which is made up of our
Expletive-Deleted, then eat their
Expletive-Deleted, which is made up
of our Expletive-Deleted that we
made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we
haven't been able to get a statement
from anyone here are the studio.

BACK TO STEVE in the E! Studio.

STEVE
Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon are on the lot,
shooting a super-secret project.
Have you seen then roaming around?

BACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios.

JULES
No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck
buying a soda at a concession stand
earlier.

STEVE
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

JULES
None whatsoever. However, to be fair,
all the feds have to work with is
murky videotape, so no one's even a
hundred percent sure what Jay and
Silent Bob look like, exactly. For
all we know, they could already be
on the lot.

As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her,
looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera
and start waving behind Jules.

INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY

Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops
out of her seat.

JUSTICE
Oh my God! Jay! No!

Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on--

The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table.

Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks
for a beat, then--

JUSTICE
Fuck it.

She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in
her pocket.

INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY

The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls
to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the
bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning.
Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity.
Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As
she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads:
SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM.

EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY

The convertible skids out, taking off.

INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY

There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush
down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap).
Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note.

SISSY
That bitch!  That fucking, fucking
bitch!!!
(to girls)
Get dressed. We're going after her.

CHRISSY
Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet.

SISSY
Which is more important to you: a
fortune in diamonds or busting a
nut?

Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there
still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties.

SISSY (O.S.)
Chrissy! Now!

CHRISSY
Fuck--

Chrissy races back up the stairs.

EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY

The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main
gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's
just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then
lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.

JAY
We gotta play this right.

Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard
booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle
and giving chase.

EXT. STUDIO LOT--DAY

Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like
an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open
alley is a background painting that's being moved by some
SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.

JAY
I hate how fake Hollywood is.

The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by
their shoulders, spinning them around.

SECURITY GUARD
Where do you think you're going?

JAY
GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!

SECURITY GUARD
This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our
suspects in custody. We just beat
them.
(into walkie-talkie)
Echo Base, I've got a ten-o-seven
here: two unauthorizeds on the lot.
Request back-up.

VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.

SECURITY GUARD
No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code
for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben
Affleck's trailer.

VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.

JAY
Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll
suck your dick off if you let us go!

SECURITY GUARD
Contrary to what you believe, not
everyone in the movie business is
gay.

JAY
Well, how about this deal: he sucks
my dick while you watch and jerk
off.

The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them,
reaching into his pants.

SECURITY GUARD
Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.

Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.

JAY
Dude, it's either this or jail. And
you know what they make you do in
jail.

Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees,
reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low
to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists
into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.  Silent
Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved.
Jay looks at him.

JAY
Well what are you waiting for, bitch?
Start sucking. Bunnggg!
(looking around)
Alright--where they shooting this
movie at?

Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in
front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door.

JAY
Worth a shot. Like a shot in the
mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you
were really gonna suck my dick.

Silent Bob shakes his head ""no,"" wide-eyed as Jay heads off.
When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, ""Yeah--I
guess I was.""

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the
crowd.

A.D.
Alright--bar extras. Follow me.

The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in
and follow inside.

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

An official-looking car tears down the road.

INT. CAR--SAME

Willenholly drives, dialing his cell phone.

PHONE VOICE
Federal Bureau of Investigation

WILLENHOLLY
Yes, this is Federal Wildlife Marshal
Willenholly. Can I speak with Agent
Sid Enmarty, please?

PHONE VOICE
One moment, please.

INT. AGENT ENMARTY'S OFFICE--SAME

AGENT SID ENMARTY works at his desk.

SPEAKER VOICE
Agent Enmarty? A Marshal Willenholly
calling.

AGENT SID
(perking up)
Holy shit! Yeah, put him through.
(calling off)
YO! INCOMING BITCH BOY PHONER!

Two other AGENTS rush in, chuckling. All gather around the
phone as Sid presses the speaker button.

AGENT SID
Willenholly?

BEGIN CROSS-CUTTING WITH WILLENHOLLY.

WILLENHOLLY
Sid? Hey, buddy. I'm calling because
I could really use your help on this
killer case I'm working.

AGENT SID
I'll bet, Will. What's it this time...
Beaver trouble? Some kind of
unauthorized marsupial trafficking?

The agents crack up, stifling their laughter.

WILLENHOLLY
(taking it in stride)
No, no--nothing like that. Say--there
aren't other people listening in,
are there?

AGENT SID
No way, man. It's just me and you
talking here.

WILLENHOLLY
Good. I'm tracking a monkey down
that's on it's way to Los Angeles,
and I could use some bureau backup.

AGENT SID
Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should
stake out Clint Eastwood's place.
Didn't he used to drive around with
a monkey that'd punch people and
drink beer?

The Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on.

WILLENHOLLY
Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone?

AGENT SID
No way--Dunston!

WILLENHOLLY
Alright, now that's not fair. I know
I didn't make it as high up as you
guys, but my job's just as important.

AGENT SID
Calm down, Will. Don't go all...
bananas on us!

The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed.

WILLENHOLLY
I come to you as a friend--as a fellow
professional--and this is the shit I
get?!

AGENT SID
You're right, Will. Tell you what--
we'll get our best man on your case
right away. You might've heard of
him. He's a doctor.

WILLENHOLLY
(excited)
Oh, a doctor?

AGENT SID
His name's Doctor Zaius!

The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly
tears up, enraged.

WILLENHOLLY
SCREW YOU GUYS!

Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking
laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries.

EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS LOT--DAY

The Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

Jay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob
looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay
looks and sees--

A COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good
Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk).
MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene.
BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR.

BEN
Where are we taking it from, Gus?

Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money.
He just shrugs.

GUS
I'm busy.

BEN
You're a true artist, Gus

MATT
Just take it from ""It's a good
course.""

BEN
Oh, now you're the director.

MATT
Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's
remember who talked who into doing
this shit in the first place. Talking
me into Dogma was one thing, but
this--

BEN
I'm sorry this is taking you away
from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-
who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-
flick you're supposed to be doing
this week.

MATT
Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you
never saw Forces of Nature?

BEN
You're like a child. What've I been
telling you? Sometimes you've gotta
do the safe picture. Sometimes, you
do it for art. Sometimes, it's the
payback picture your friend says you
owe him--

They take a beat and look at the camera. Then--

BEN
And sometimes, you go back to the
well.

MATT
And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.

BEN
Now that's just mean.

Jay turns excitedly to Bob.

JAY
This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick,
'cause that's those two fucks from
that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do
is figure out a way to get close to
them--

The A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto
the set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.

A.D.
Just stand there and react. Don't
say anything.

Bob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.

JAY
(off A.D.'s comment)
That's pretty funny.

A.D.
(calling out)
Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's
go for picture.

Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are
oblivious.

JAY
On the count of three, we rush those
fucks and beat the shit out of 'em.
'Cause if they're all fucked up,
they can't make the move, right?
Alright, then.  One--two--

CLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)
Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.

Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C.

The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face.
It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.

CLAPPER/LOADER
Scene sixteen, take five.

The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben
looks to Gus.

BEN
Action, Gus?

Gus looks up from counting his money.

GUS
Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.

Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.

BEN/CHUCKIE
You should check it out, it's a good
course. But, you know, frankly, I
found the class rather elementary.

CLARK
You know, I don't doubt that it was.
I remember that class. It was just
between recess and lunch.

BEN/CHUCKIE
Are we gonna have a problem, again?

CLARK
There's no problem. I was still just
hoping you might give me some insight
into the evolution of the market
economy in the Southern Colonies.
See, Wood says--

MATT/WILL
(stepping in)
What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be
back here regurgitating Gordon Wood.
But you forgot about Vickers--

CLARK
No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up
on inherited wealth, Hunting. But
you're not the angry, brilliant young
mind you once were, just itching to
vent your frustrations.

In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out
of the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the
A.D.

CLARK
Once Sean told you it wasn't your
fault, you lost the edge, William.
You stopped hitting the books with a
vengeance, and now I've read shit
you haven't even heard about yet.
Face facts, my friend--love made you
a soft little pussy boy, unable to
stand up to an academic showdown,
like you used to. You're just no
longer that good--Will Hunting.
(gets in his face)
Now how do you like them apples?

Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking
downwards, steaming.

BEN/CHUCKIE
I don't like the sound of them apples.
Will, what're we gonna do now?

MATT/WILL
Chuckie--
(snarling)
It's Hunting season.

Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands.
He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will
stands there, guns smoking.

BEN/CHUCKIE
Apple sauce, bitch.

Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the
Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other
SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a
ten-oh-seven on our hands.

BEN
Wait a second! I wasn't with any
hookers today!

The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He
points, screaming.

SECURITY GUARD
THERE THEY ARE!

Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.

JAY
Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms,
yo.

Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the
Security guards.  Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.

MATT
If anyone's looking for me, I'll be
in my trailer trying to figure out
how I got here from an Academy Award.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door,
blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across
from them and head inside a door.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see--

Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar-
looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The
Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4

CLAPPER/LOADER
Scream four, scene thirty-seven,
take one.
(claps it and rushes
off)

WES CRAVEN
Action!

The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff,
until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.

SHANNEN DOHERTY
Alright, you bastard! Let's see who
you really are!

Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal
SUZANNE.

Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.

SHANNEN DOHERTY
Fucking Miramax--
(getting up)
CUT!

Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.

WES CRAVEN
Shannen, usually I say ""cut.""

SHANNEN DOHERTY
A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't
even trying anymore, are you?

WES CRAVEN
The market research suggest that
people love monkeys.

Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.

JAY
WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!

They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.

WES CRAVEN
See?

Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.

EXT. LOT--DAY

Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne.
On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting.
The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--

At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four
Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking
their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the
other Security Guards gaining.

JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?

Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the
bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.

Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and
jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling
away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse.
Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.

JAY
PUNCH IT!!!

Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the
vehicle, taking flight,

Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--

Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front
basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a
soundstage) a la E.T.

Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then
they look ahead and let out a scream.

The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage
Building.

INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling
onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.

JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent
Bob, looking down as them.

JAMES
Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.

JASON
Are you guys alright?
(off Suzanne)
Hey! They've got a monkey!

Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.

JAY
Yo, I think that shit just kicked
in.

JAMES
Let's get you guys on your feet.

James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All
stare at one another, perplexed,

Then--

JAY
(to James)
See man?  Its never, ""Hey--you were
in Loser, or, ""Dude--you rocked in
Boys and Girls."" It always comes
back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted
by it.!

JAMES
Well, you put your dick in a pie,
dude--

JASON
Enough!
(to Jay)
Jason Biggs.

JAY
Yo-you really get to third base with
the Russsian chick like you did in
the movies?

JASON
You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.

JAY
She's fucking hot, man. If I was
you, I'd been like--

Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look
on, bewildered.

JAY
(off James's-look)
What, man? You never did one of these?

Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James,
blown away.

JAY
Holy shit? You're the Dawson!

JAMES
It's James, actually. James Van Der
Beek.

JAY
Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing
Joey away from you? If I was you, I
would've drowned his ass in your
Creek and shit!

JAMES
I know, Because what--is Josh better
looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean,
who on earth is better looking that
me? I ask you.

JAY
Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did
you ever get to third base with her?

JAMES
Well, there was this one time--
(catching himself)
Wait a second--who are you guys?!

JASON
They're our stunt doubles, dumbass.
(to Jay)
Right?

JAY
Stunt doubles for what?

JAMES
The movie we start shooting in a few
minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike
Back.

JASON
(to Bob)
You're doubling me. I'm playing
Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.

JAMES
Bob

JASON
Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA
Ray.

JAMES
Jay! Shit, did you even read the
script?

JASON
There's a script?

Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his
finger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a
huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.

JAY
These are the guys who are playing
us, yo. We take them out, and bickety-
bam! No movie.

Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off,
leaving Jay and Bob to huddle.

JASON
(off Jay and Bob, to
James)
What's with the weird, gay huddle
going on over there?

JAMES
What's gay about it? It's two guys
talking in a corner. Man--why are
you such a homophobe.

JASON
I'm not a homophobe.

JAMES
You are. You're always calling things
gay. ""Ooo--look at the gay huddle,
dude!""

Suzanne approaches them.

JASON
Hey--look at the monkey.

JAMES
Next you're going to tell me the
monkey's gay.

JASON
He's so cute--
(to Suzanne)
C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--

Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.

While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a
beating are heard, O.C.

JAY
Alright, here's what we do: start
swinging, and don't stop until those
young Hollywood fucks are out of
commission. Ready? Break!

Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-
eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied
and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward,
clasped like a champion.

JAY
That's one funky monkey.

Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.

VOICE (O.S.)
Mister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--
Beek? This is Security. We've got a
pair of intruders at large, and they
crashed through a window we thought
might be yours.

JAY
(to door; deepening
voice)
Uh--yeah. They're in here.

SECURITY GUARD
Do they have you hostage? Should we
call your publicists?

JAY
NO! I mean, we kicked those guys'
asses bad. They're--knocked out.

EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME

The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.

SECURITY GUARD
Great work, sirs! If you let us in,
we'll take over--

JAY (O.S.)
(through door)
NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in
here! Together!

The Security guard look at one another.

SECURITY GUARD
Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the
door, sirs.

The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job
face to the rest.

INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it
and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods,
and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the
vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.

JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?! How
are we gonna get out of here without
them seeing us?

Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet,
smiling.

EXT. LOT--DAY

The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a
waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and
Silent Bob.

JAMES
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!

JASON
HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M
THE PIE-FUCKER.

SECURITY GUARD
(to Cops)
He'll be the pie--in prison.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY

Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).

JAY
This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In
these outfits we're totally incognito.

Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.

A.D.
Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?
Great--you've changed costumes
already. Let's get you to set.
(pulling them off)
The director doesn't like to be kept
waiting.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET

It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side,
near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs
the hustling, white crew.

DIRECTOR
Look at all these crackers, Seventy
million dollars and I can't even get
a black grip?

A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.

P.A.
Here's your coffee, sir.

DIRECTOR
(eyes the coffee)
You spit in this?  Because I know
all you white folks are pissed off
that the studio'd entrust a multi-
million dollar to a brother.

P.A.
I didn't spit in it, sir.

DIRECTOR
Then taste it! Go on!

The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it
back to the Director.

P.A.
It's all good, sir.

DIRECTOR
No it ain't all good. Oh, you think
I want it now, after your lips touched
the cup? Get the fuck off my set!

P.A.
You the man, sir.

DIRECTOR
No you the Man! And that's the
problem!

The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously
skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.

BANKY
Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky
Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and
Chronic. We met a few weeks back.
I'm the executive producer.

DIRECTOR/CHAKA
Oh--you're the executive producer,
hunh? Well go ""produce"" me a latte
no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?

BANKY
Banky. I just wanted you to know
that I respect your work as an artist.
I'm something of an artist myself. I
was the inker on the comic book.

CHAKA
An inker? What, like you trace?

Banky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.

A.D.
Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the
set, Chaka.

CHAKA
I don't see 'em. Where are they?
(into bullhorn)
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS
PIECE OF SHIT?!

On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake
rock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob
survey the set, amazed.

JAY
This must've set 'em back a couple
hundred bucks.

CHAKA
Look at this shit.
(off their outfits)
A gay hood ornament, and the color
Purple.

JAY
Who the fuck are you?

CHAKA
Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking
director, is who I am. Chaka Luther
King. The creator of all of this.

JAY
Wait a sec--I thought Holden and
Banky created this shit.

CHAKA
And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it
back for all the shit you people
have stolen from us! Did you know, I
came up with the idea for Sesame
Street before PBS? I was going to
call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.
(beat)
Alright--enough small talk. Let's
shoot it.

Chaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.

JAY
Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna
direct us?

CHAKA
I'll be directing you to the food
stamps line after I fire your ass,
if you talk back like that to me
again!

JAY
But we don't know what we're supposed
to do here. We didn't even read the
script.

CHAKA
So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did
the studio.
(pointing O.C.)
Look man, it's not hard. In this
scene, the bad guy breaks into the
Bluntcave.  You make up some shit,
fight him for a while, I film it, I
yell ""cut,"" and then head back to my
trailer, where I got more white women
waiting for me there than the first
lifeboat off the Titanic!
(confidentially)
They all want a part of the movie,
and I got just the part for 'em.

Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.

CHAKA
LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!

A.D. (O.S.)
QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!

Chaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him
with another cup of coffee.

P.A.
I got you another cup of coffee,
sir. Spit free.

Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.

The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and
Bob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.

CLAPPER/LOADER
I just wanna say that I loved when
you fucked that pie.
(calling off)
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,
SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!

The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From
behind the monitor,

Chaka calls out--

CHAKA
ACTION!

Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for
a beat. Then--

JAY/CHRONIC
Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.

Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit
the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the
arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking
man with huge, overgrown FISTS.

JAY/CHRONIC
What the fuck?

COCK-KNOCKER
You thought I'd never find your
precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp
Knight? But now you and your sidekick
are finally in the grasp of Cock-
Knocker!

JAY/CHRONIC
Why do they call you ""Cock-Knocker""?

Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls.
Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a
vibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button
on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a
light saber.

COCK-KNOCKER
Any last words before I bust your
balls, Bluntman?

Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--

A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the
placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.
It's out of his reach.

Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his
hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.

Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.
The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive
pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair
start light saber dueling.

CHAKA
(from behind monitor)
Damn! Now that was one special effect!
This picture's gonna make House Party
look like House Party Two!

A.D.
Or House Party Three?

CHAKA
Shut the fuck up!

Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive
blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the
ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He
lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-
Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on
his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver
a saber kill-shot, when we hear--

JAY (O.S.)
YO-BITCH-FISTS!

Cock-Knocker turns to see--

Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a
double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la
the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).

JAY
Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.

Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong
Saber.

CHAKA
(from behind the
monitor)
I think George Lucas is going to sue
somebody--

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a
shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside
the flashing red light.

WILLENHOLLY
(looking around)
So, this is Hollywood?
(suddenly full of
purpose)
Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent
Bob.

Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two
shots, O.C.

WILLENHOLLY
FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!

Willenholly goes wide-eyed.

It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a
kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a
Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare
back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking
bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.

WILLENHOLLY
Oh my God--
(to kids)
Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a
warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm
on the wrong, uh--wrong set.

The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the
O.C. Willenholly.

KID
You killed Mooby--
(to Kids)
LET'S GET HIM!!!

The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as
he's attacked.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.

COCK-KNOCKER
(breaking character)
You are not upstaging me, Van Der
Beek!

Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker,
hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear
reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade
the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other
hand.

COCK-KNOCKER
(to O.C. Chaka)
CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A
""CUT""!

On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's
huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).

Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber,
Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.

JAY
Now whose balls have been busted,
bitch?

Suddenly, a gun shot rings out.

All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun
first on Jay, then Bob.

WILLENHOLLY
The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and
Silent Bob!
(revealing badge:
calling out)
Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal
Wildlife Marshal. These men are the
leaders of a terrorist organization
wanted for the abduction of a monkey.

VOICE (O.S.)
They didn't really steal that monkey.

All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows.
Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.

JUSTICE
It was just a diversion so we could
steal these.

Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing
them.

JUSTICE
And they're not the leaders of
C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.

WILLENHOLLY
No--the clit's real. The female orgasm
is a myth.

JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Are you guys alright?

JAY
I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty
Fuck.

JUSTICE
(smiling)
You remembered.
(back to business)
It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,
Chrissy, and I are international
jewel thieves. We were setting you
up as a patsy, but I couldn't go
through with it, because I... because
I love you.

JAY
Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me,
right?

VOICE (O.S.)
If she does, it'll be considered
necrophilia.

All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the
shadows, guns drawn.

SISSY
Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.
(to Justice)
Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad
time?

MISSY
You should've just let these guys go
down, Jussy.

JAY
Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was
waiting until I got to know her a
little better. See, there was this
little angel on my shoulder, and he
said--

CHRISSY
Shut the fuck up before I shoot you
where you stand in your pansy red
booties.

JAY
(looking down)
Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red
booties!
(to Bob)
Man--why the fuck didn't you tell
me?

SISSY
Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.

JUSTICE
I can't do that, Sissy

SISSY
(points her gun at
Jay)
Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.

CHAKA
YO!

All turn to look at Chaka.

CHAKA
Would any of you lovely ladies like
a private audition to be in my movie?

Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on
the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and
running for cover.

Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.

Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed
craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start
firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren
craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented
can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are
out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and
reload. From behind his table,

Willenholly yells--

WILLENHOLLY
WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M
JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!

CHRISSY
TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,
TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!

MISSY
AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.

WILLENHOLLY
ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!

The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire
again.

Chaka ducks behind the monitor.

CHAKA
A shitload of white people with guns?
Time to get my black ass out of here!

He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each
other defensively, striking kung fu poses.

SISSY
You really let me down, Justice.
Throwing it all away for a little
stoner with bad pronunciation.

JAY (O.S.)
HEY!

JUSTICE
(ignoring him)
What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which
fighting style do you want me to
kick your ass in?

SISSY
Are you kidding me? I taught you all
all your moves myself. There's not a
style you can bust that I can't defend
against.

JUSTICE
You're no match for my ""Shaolin Monk.""

SISSY
Yeah, but I can bury you with my
""Crouching Tiger.""

JUSTICE
A little ""Venus's--flytrap""?

SISSY
I'll counter with ""Dragon Crane.""

JUSTICE
How about a little ""Bitch, My Man
Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy""?

SISSY
(beat; smiles)
Bring it on.

Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch
into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and
screaming.

Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.

JAY
Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other
one's shirt off and we see some tit.

Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins
them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.

BANKY
Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I
just wanted to say hi. I'm--

JAY
Banky fucking Edwards! Just the
motherfucker we came to see!

BANKY
(shocked)
Holy shit! What the fuck are you
guys doing here?!

Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the
floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

BANKY
Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!

JAY
All these assholes are calling us
names on the Internet, 'cause of
this stupid movie!

BANKY
I feel for you boys--I really do.
Those Net snipers can be really cruel.
But Miramax paid me a shitload of
money for Bluntman and Chronic, so
it occurs to me that people bad-
mouthing you on some web-site is
none of my FUCKING CONCERN!

SILENT BOB
Oh--but I think it is.

Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.

JAY
Here we go again--

SILENT BOB
Shut the fuck up.
(to Banky)
We had a deal with you on the comics
for likeness rights. And as we're
not only the artistic basis but also
the character basis for your
intellectual property, Bluntman and
Chronic, when we said property was
optioned by Miramax Films you were
legally obliged to secure our
permission to transfer the concept
to another medium. As you failed to
do that, you're in breach of the
original contract--ergo, you find
yourself in a very actionable
position.

Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a
beat, Jay adds--

JAY
Yeah.

Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head
and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.

BANKY
So, what do you guys want, to go
away and take your lady friends with
you?

JAY
Shitcan this movie so we don't get
called names on the Internet anymore.

BANKY
Even if there's no movie, people are
still free to talk shit about you on
the Internet. That's what the
Internet's for: slandering others
anonymously.  Stopping the flick
isn't going to stop that!

In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the
air.

JAY
Well this isn't fair!  We went to
Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole
a monkey, we got shot at, and got
punched in the motherfucking nuts!
We ain't leaving empty-handed!

On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.

JAY
What's up baby? You look good!

BANKY
Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?

JAY
Oh yeah.
(pushing Sissy off
him)
Get the fuck offa me, pig!

Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.

Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

BANKY
You guys are gonna ruin my movie
career.

JAY
Well, we want something for our mental
anguish.

BANKY
Tell you what: we'll settle this
monetarily. I'll give you half of
what I made.

JAY
Half?!?

BANKY
Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll
give you two-thirds of what I made!

JAY
Fuck-you--you already said half? You
can't take it back!

Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.

BANKY
Done

Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing
each other.

SISSY
Your shit is so tired, Justice!

JUSTICE
Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!

Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.

Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop
Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out.

Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.

WILLENHOLLY
Hello? Truce?
(beat)
I think I killed both of them.

Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing
a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind
him, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her
handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.

JUSTICE
C'mon guys. It's over.

Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.

JAY
Yo, I was just about to jump in there
and get your back.

Then, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.

JAY
Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get
out of here!

JUSTICE
No. I'm tired of running.

Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps
his face.

JUSTICE
You awake, Marshal? Marshal?

WILLENHOLLY
(tries to move but
can't)
Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey
shot me in the ass and paralyzed me!
Oh the irony!

JUSTICE
(off Suzanne's gun)
You're not paralyzed. It was just a
tranquilizer.

WILLENHOLLY
Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!
My friends in the Bureau are never
gonna let me live this down!

JUSTICE
You have friends in the F.B.I.?

WILLENHOLLY
(crying)
They all made it in, but I failed
the exam. Why the hell else do you
think I became a Federal Wildlife
Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!

Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking.
Then--

JUSTICE
Maybe not. I can make you a deal
that'll get you into the F.B.I.,
regardless of test scores.

WILLENHOLLY
What kind of deal?

JUSTICE
You drop the charges against Jay and
Silent Bob and say you never found
the ape.  Make sure the world knows
they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.

JAY
Now wait a second--

JUSTICE
I'll explain later, Jay
(to Willenholly)
In exchange, I'll give you the
diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,
Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I
want a reduced sentence.

WILLENHOLLY
You'd be willing to do that?

JUSTICE
(off Jay)
For him? I'd be willing to do
anything.

Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands.

JUSTICE
I'm an international jewel thief
who's facing a jail sentence.

JAY
That's alright. I'm a junkie with a
monkey.

JUSTICE
If I go to prison, will you wait for
me?

JAY
I don't know. Will we fuck when you
get out?

Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should
say it all, but--

JAY
Don't change the subject. Will we
fuck when you get out?

JUSTICE
Snoogans.

Justice and Jay kiss again.

Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs
his face and kisses him.

Willenholly looks to Banky.

WILLENHOLLY
Wow. There's a lot of love in the
room.

BANKY
Regardless of what you may have heard.
I do not kiss guys.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER

Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls
her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.

WILLENHOLLY
Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.
(to Jay: friendly)
Hey--stop stealing monkeys.

JAY
Fuck you.

WILLENHOLLY
Fair enough.

Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the
car.

JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Wait for me.

JAY
What--here?

Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,
leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking
down the lot.

BANKY
Well, boys--you're rich in love--
(indicating Jay)
Well, you're in love. And to top
that off, you've got your own monkey.
What more could two guys from Jersey
possibly want?

JAY
All those fucks to stop talking shit
about us on the Internet, for
starters.

BANKY
What do I keep telling you? There's
not much you can do to stop that.
Well, short of showing up at all
their houses and beating the shit
out of them, I guess.

Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and
smile.

JAY
(to Bob)
You know--with all that money we're
gonna make we can buy a lotta plane
tickets.

START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE

EXT. SKY--DAY

A passenger JET flies through the sky.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check
the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod
at each other, and cross the street.

INT. HOUSE--DAY

The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent
Bob standing in the doorway.

MOTHER
Can I help you?

JAY
Yes. Ma'am, Does--
(reading of paper)
William Dusky live here?

MOTHER
Yes. He's my son.

JAY
May we talk to him, please.

MOTHER
One moment.

She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes
to the door.

KID
Yeah?

JAY
Yo--do you post as--
(reading off paper)
Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?

KID
Yeah.

JAY
And did you write ""Fuck Jay and Silent
Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?

KID
Yeah, a while ago. So?

Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him
outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front
lawn.

EXT. SKY--DAY

The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite
direction.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY

Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.
They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the
door.

JAY
On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say
Jay and Silent Bob--
(reading off paper)
""--are fucking clown shoes. If they
were real, I'd beat the shit out of
them for being so stupid.""

KID
(chuckling)
Yeah.

JAY
Really--

Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit
out of him.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.

EXT. RECTORY--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.

INT. OFFICE--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT

The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!

WORLD PREMIERE!

The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see
DANTE and RANDAL.

RANDAL
Now that was worse then Clash of the
Titans.

DANTE
I still can't believe Judy Dench
played me.

RANDAL
Hey--remind me to renew that
restraining order.

DANTE
Why?

RANDAL
Because I'm gonna blast the flick on
the Internet tonight.

STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.

STEVE-DAVE
Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent
comic book movie?

WALT
Tell'em Steve-Dave!

STEVE-DAVE
Would you stop saying that?

ALYSSA and TRISH come out.

TRISH
Well, that was just another paean to
male adolescence and its refusal to
grow up.

ALYSSA
Yeah, sis--but it was better than
Mallrats. At least Holden had the
good sense to keep his name off of
it.

TRISH
Why wouldn't Miramax option his other
comic instead? You know--the one he
drew about you and him and your
relationship?

ALYSSA
You mean Chasing Amy? That would
never work as a movie.

BANKY and HOOPER exit.

BANKY
I'm so fucking embarrassed--

HOOPER
Honey, you should be. They took your
characters and reduced them to one
ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was
like watching Batman and Robin again.

BANKY
Thanks. That means a lot coming from
the guy who pretends to be Shaft as
opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

HOOPER
I don't hear you complaining nightly.
In fact, the only thing I do hear
you say is ""Yes, Hooper! Cradle the
balls and work the shaft!""

BANKY
(looking around)
Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in
public!

A guy behind them calls out to Banks.

GUY
Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!

BANKY
(recognizing him)
You--!

GUY
That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm
back for round two!

Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him,
while Hooper tries to break them up.

WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a
prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.

WILLENHOLLY
You know, I don't get out to the
movies much. But I'd have to say
Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!

JUSTICE
Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

WILLENHOLLY
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.

JAY
YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,
FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE
WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!

WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing
""The Bird."" During the song, Morris points to--

Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's
still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob,
they nod at each other and--

Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage,
and dance us out to the coda, which reads--

CODA

Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3
million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial
failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly
drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat
boards, and over the course of the next year, while they
waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay
and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out
of them.

CREDITS. THEN--

INT. NOWHERE

A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW
ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips
off.

Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_St.%20Louis%20Blues_Bessie%20Smith%20Louis%20Armstrong.ttl,Luke Davis,7.1. From The Jazz Age to bebop,"The black men may have dominated the instrumental and compositional aspects of jazz but there were plenty of women involved within the vocals, such as Ella Fitzgerald, Bessie Smith and Billie Holliday, all former gospel singers who took their use of melisma and blues tones into the sounds and syncopations of jazz

The 1920s became known as the Jazz Age, where the soloists became more prominent. During this time, Louis Armstrong led his band The Hot Five, originally consisting of his wife, Lil Hardin Armstrong, on piano, Kid Ory on trombone, Johnny Dodds on clarinet and Johnny St. Cyr on guitar and banjo. The key to their success and Armstrong’s status within jazz was his ability to improvise as well as implementing the use of “scatting”. A jazz diaspora from New Orleans to Harlem took place in the late 1910s and by the 1920s, it sparked was to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. The name denoted the rebirth of black consciousness that took place for nearly one and a half decades in the area. Initially, ragtime was the music of choices but due to their poor quality, of little likening to Joplin et al (Gioia, 1997), but eventually a technique known as the Harlem Stride Piano crept into the repertoire of jazz musicians. The concept behind the stride piano involved the left hand playing out four beats, switching between a single note or interval on the first and third beats, and a chord on the second and fourth beats (Carmichael, 2001, p.4). This way of playing took a great deal skill and helped to develop the genre whilst giving Harlem its own distinctive style. Soon, the emergence of big bands and “swing” music of the 30s took hold, thanks to the likes of Duke Ellington. However, big band became synonymous with white musicians towards the late 30s, into wartime America, as it became the music most associated with World War II in the US (Glenn Miller being the most famous, both for his big band exploits and his disappearance in action)

European music had always played some part in the development of jazz, but never as fundamental as in post-war jazz. Bebop was introduced in the 40s, pioneered by saxophonist Charlie “Bird” Parker, Thelonius Monk and Dizzy Gillespie amongst others, which soon developed into hard bop and eventually free jazz or “avant garde”EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

To shoot off the legs of his rival

And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_Youd%20Be%20So%20Nice%20to%20Come%20Home%20To_Ella%20Fitzgerald.ttl,Howard Zinn,Chapter 15: Self Help in Hard Times,"The war was hardly over, it was February 1919, the IWW leadership was in jail, but the IWW idea of the general strike became reality for five days in Seattle, Washington, when a walkout of 100,000 working people brought the city to a halt.

It began with 35,000 shipyard workers striking for a wage increase. They appealed for support to the Seattle Central Labor Council, which recommended a city-wide strike, and in two weeks 110 locals-mostly American Federation of Labor, only a few IWW-voted to strike. The rank and file of each striking local elected three members to a General Strike Committee, and on February 6, 1939, at 10:00 A.M., the strike began.

Unity was not easy to achieve. The TWW locals were in tension with the AFL locals. Japanese locals were admitted to the General Strike Committee but were not given a vote. Still, sixty thousand union members were out, and forty thousand other workers joined in sympathy.

Seattle workers had a radical tradition. During the war, the president of the Seattle AFL, a socialist, was imprisoned for opposing the draft, was tortured, and there were great labor rallies in the streets to protest.

The city now stopped functioning, except for activities organized by the strikers to provide essential needs. Firemen agreed to stay on the job. Laundry workers handled only hospital laundry. Vehicles authorized to move carried signs ""Exempted by the General Strike Committee."" Thirty-five neighborhood milk stations were set up. Every day thirty thousand meals were prepared in large kitchens, then transported to halls all over the city and served cafeteria style, with strikers paying twenty-five cents a meal, the general public thirty-five cents. People were allowed to eat as much as they wanted of the beef stew, spaghetti, bread, and coffee.

A Labor War Veteran's Guard was organized to keep the peace. On the blackboard at one of its headquarters was written: ""The purpose of this organization is to preserve law and order without the use of force. No volunteer will have any police power or be allowed to carry weapons of any sort, but to use persuasion only."" During the strike, crime in the city decreased. The commander of the U.S. army detachment sent into the area told the strikers' committee that in forty years of military experience he hadn't seen so quiet and orderly a city. A poem printed in the Seattle Union Record (a daily newspaper put out by labor people) by someone named Anise:

What scares them most is

That NOTHING HAPPENS!

They are ready For DISTURBANCES.

They have machine guns

And soldiers,

But this SMILING SILENCE

is uncanny.
The business men

Don't understand

That sort of weapon...

It is your SMILE

That is UPSETTING

Their reliance

On Artillery, brother!

It is the garbage wagons

That go along the street

Marked ""EXEMPT

by STRIKE COMMIITED.""

It is the milk stations

That are getting better daily,
And the three hundred

WAR Veterans of Labor

Handling the crowds

WITHOUT GUNS,

For these things speak

Of a NEW POWER

And a NEW WORLD

That they do not feel

At HOME in.

The mayor swore in 2,400 special deputies, many of them students at the University of Washington. Almost a thousand sailors and marines were brought into the city by the U.S. government. The general strike ended after five days, according to the General Strike Committee because of pressure from the international officers of the various unions, as well as the difficulties of living in a shut-down city.

The strike had been peaceful. But when it was over, there were raids and arrests: on the Socialist party headquarters, on a printing plant. Thirty-nine members of the IWW were jailed as ""ring- leaders of anarchy.""

In Centralia, Washington, where the IWW had been organizing lumber workers, the lumber interests made plans to get rid of the IWW. On November 11, 1919, Armistice Day, the Legion paraded through town with rubber hoses and gas pipes, and the IWW prepared for an attack. When the Legion passed the IWW hall, shots were fired-it is unclear who fired first. They stormed the hall, there was more firing, and three Legion men were killed.

Inside the headquarters was an IWW member, a lumberjack named Frank Everett, who had been in France as a soldier while the IWW national leaders were on trial for obstructing the war effort. Everett was in army uniform and carrying a rifle. He emptied it into the crowd, dropped it, and ran for the woods, followed by a mob. He started to wade across the river, found the current too strong, turned, shot the leading man dead, threw his gun into the river, and fought the mob with his fists. They dragged him back to town behind an automobile, suspended him from a telegraph pole, took him down, locked him in jail. That night, his jailhouse door was broken down, he was dragged out, put on the floor of a car, his genitals were cut off, and then he was taken to a bridge, hanged, and his body riddled with bullets.
No one was ever arrested for Everett's murder, but eleven Wobblies were put on trial for killing an American Legion leader during the parade, and six of them spent fifteen years in prison.

Why such a reaction to the general strike, to the organizing of the Wobblies? A statement by the mayor of Seattle suggests that the Establishment feared not just the strike itself but what it symbolized. He said:

The so-called sympathetic Seattle strike was an attempted revolution. That there was no violence does not alter the fact. .. . The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for the overthrow of the industrial system; here first, then everywhere. .. . True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practiced in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community. . .. That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt-no matter how achieved.

Furthermore, the Seattle general strike took place in the midst of a wave of postwar rebellions all over the world. A writer in The Nation commented that year:

The most extraordinary phenomenon of the present time ... is the unprecedented revolt of the rank and file...

In Russia it has dethroned the Czar.... In Korea and India and Egypt and Ireland it keeps up an unyielding resistance to political tyranny. In England it brought about the railway strike, against the judgement of the men's own executives. In Seattle and San Francisco it has resulted in the stevedores' recent refusal to handle arms or supplies destined for the overthrow of the Soviet Government. In one district of Illinois it manifested itself in a resolution of striking miners, unanimously requesting their state executive ""to go to Hell"". In Pittsburgh, according to Mr. Gompers, it compelled the reluctant American Federation officers to call the steel strike, lest the control pass into the hands of the I.W.W.'s and other ""radicals"". In New York, it brought about the longshoremen's strike and kept the men out in defiance of union officials, and caused the upheaval in the printing trade, which the international officers, even though the employers worked hand in glove with them, were completely unable to control.

The common man .. . losing faith in the old leadership, has experienced a new access of self- confidence, or at least a new recklessness, a readiness to take chances on his own account . .. authority cannot any longer be imposed from above; it comes automatically from below.

In the steel mills of western Pennsylvania later in 1919, where men worked twelve hours a day, six days a week, doing exhausting work under intense heat, 100,000 steelworkers were signed up in twenty different AFL craft unions. A National Committee attempting to tie them together in their organizing drive found in the summer of 1919 ""the men are letting it be known that if we do not do something for them they will take the matter into their own hands.""

The National Council was getting telegrams like the one from the Johnstown Steel Workers Council: ""Unless the National Committee authorizes a national strike vote to be taken this week we will be compelled to go on strike here alone."" William Z. Foster (later a Communist leader, at this time secretary-treasurer to the National Committee in charge of organizing) received a telegram from organizers in the Youngstown district: ""We cannot he expected to meet the enraged workers, who will consider us traitors if strike is postponed.""

There was pressure from President Woodrow Wilson and Samuel Gompers, AFL president, to postpone the strike. But the steelworkers were too insistent, and in September 1919, not only the 100,000 union men but 250,000 others went out on strike.

The sheriff of Allegheny County swore in as deputies five thousand employees of U.S. Steel who had not gone on strike, and announced that outdoor meetings would be forbidden. A report of the Interchurch World Movement made at the time said:

In Monessen .. . the policy of the State Police was simply to club men off the streets and drive them into their homes.... In Braddock .. . when a striker was clubbed in the street he would be taken to jail, kept there over night . . . Many of those arrested in Newcastle .. . were ordered not to be released until the strike was over.

The Department of Justice moved in, carrying out raids on workers who were aliens, holding them for deportation. At Gary, Indiana, federal troops were sent in.

Other factors operated against the strikers. Most were recent immigrants, of many nationalities, many languages. Sherman Service, Inc., hired by the steel corporations to break the strike, instructed its men in South Chicago: ""We want you to stir up as much bad feeling as you possibly can between the Serbians and the Italians. Spread data among the Serbians that the Italians are going back to work.... Urge them to go back to work or the Italians will get their jobs."" More than thirty thousand black workers were brought into the area as strikebreakers-they had been excluded from AFL unions and so felt no loyalty to unionism.

As the strike dragged on, the mood of defeat spread, and workers began to drift hack to work. After ten weeks, the number of strikers was down to 110,000, and then the National Committee called the strike off.

In the year following the war, 120,000 textile workers struck in New England and New Jersey, and 30,000 silk workers struck in Paterson, New Jersey. In Boston the police went out on strike, and in New York City cigarmakers, shirtmakers, carpenters, bakers, teamsters, and barbers were out on strike. In Chicago, the press reported, ""More strikes and lockouts accompany the mid-summer heat than ever known before at any one time."" Five thousand workers at International Harvester and five thousand city workers were in the streets.

When the twenties began, however, the situation seemed under control. The IWW was destroyed, the Socialist party falling apart. The strikes were beaten down by force, and the economy was doing just well enough for just enough people to prevent mass rebellion.

Congress, in the twenties, put an end to the dangerous, turbulent flood of immigrants (14 million between 1900 and 1920) by passing laws setting immigration quotas: the quotas favored Anglo- Saxons, kept out black and yellow people, limited severely the coming of Latins, Slavs, Jews. No African country could send more than 100 people; 100 was the limit for China, for Bulgaria, for Palestine; 34,007 could come from England or Northern Ireland, but only 3,845 from Italy; 51,227 from Germany, but only 124 from Lithuania; 28,567 from the Irish Free State, but only 2,248 from Russia.

The Ku Klux Klan was revived in the 1920s, and it spread into the North. By 1924 it had 4M million members. The NAACP seemed helpless in the face of mob violence and race hatred everywhere. The impossibility of the black persons ever being considered equal in white America was the theme of the nationalist movement led in the 1920s by Marcus Garvey. He preached black pride, racial separation, and a return to Africa, which to him held the only hope for black unity and survival. But Garvey's movement, inspiring as it was to some blacks, could not make much headway against the powerful white supremacy currents of the postwar decade.

There was some truth to the standard picture of the twenties as a time of prosperity and fun-the Jazz Age, the Roaring Twenties. Unemployment was down, from 4,270,000 in 1921 to a little over 2 million in 1927. The general level of wages for workers rose. Some farmers made a lot of money. The 40 percent of all families who made over $2,000 a year could buy new gadgets: autos, radios, refrigerators. Millions of people were not doing badly-and they could be shut out of the picture the others-the tenant farmers, black and white, the immigrant families in the big cities either without work or not making enough to get the basic necessities.

But prosperity was concentrated at the top. While from 1922 to 1929 real wages in manufacturing went up per capita 1.4 percent a year, the holders of common stocks gained 16.4 percent a year. Six million families (42 percent of the total) made less than $1,000 a year. One-tenth of 1 percent of the families at the top received as much income as 42 percent of the families at the bottom, according to a report of the Brookings Institution. Every year in the 1920s, about 25,000 workers were killed on the job and 100,000 permanently disabled. Two million people in New York City lived in tenements condemned as rattraps.

The country was full of little industrial towns like Muncie, Indiana, where, according to Robert and Helen Lynd (Middletown), the class system was revealed by the time people got up in the morning: for two-thirds of the city's families, ""the father gets up in the dark in winter, eats hastily in the kitchen in the gray dawn, and is at work from an hour to two and a quarter hours before his children have to be at school.""

There were enough well-off people to push the others into the background. And with the rich controlling the means of dispensing information, who would tell? Historian Merle Curti observed about the twenties:

It was, in fact, only the upper ten percent of the population that enjoyed a marked increase in real income. But the protests which such facts normally have evoked could not make themselves widely or effectively felt. This was in part the result of the grand strategy of the major political parties. In part it was the result of the fact that almost all the chief avenues to mass opinion were now controlled by large-scale publishing industries.

Some writers tried to break through: Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Lewis Mumford. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in an article, ""Echoes of the Jazz Age,"" said: ""It was borrowed time anyway-the whole upper tenth of a nation living with the insouciance of a grand due and the casualness of chorus girls."" He saw ominous signs amid that prosperity: drunkenness, unhappiness, violence:

A classmate killed his wife and himself on Long Island, another tumbled ""accidentally"" from a skyscraper in Philadelphia, another purposely from a skyscraper in New York. One was killed in a speak-easy in Chicago; another was beaten to death in a speak-easy in New York and crawled home to the Princeton Club to die; still another had his skull crushed by a maniac's axe in an insane asylum where he was confined.

Sinclair Lewis captured the false sense of prosperity, the shallow pleasure of the new gadgets for the middle classes, in his novel Babbitt:

It was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires.

He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family, and disliked himself for disliking them.

Women had finally, after long agitation, won the right to vote in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, but voting was still a middle-class and upper-class activity. Eleanor Flexner, recounting the history of the movement, says the effect of female suffrage was that ""women have shown the same tendency to divide along orthodox party lines as male voters.""

Few political figures spoke out for the poor of the twenties. One was Fiorello La Guardia, a Congressman from a district of poor immigrants in East Harlem (who ran, oddly, on both Socialist and Republican tickets). In the mid-twenties he was made aware by people in his district of the high price of meat. When La Guardia asked Secretary of Agriculture William Jardine to investigate the high price of meat, the Secretary sent him a pamphlet on how to use meat economically. La Guardia wrote back:

I asked for help and you send me a bulletin. The people of New York City cannot feed their children on Department bulletins.. .. Your bulletins . .. are of no use to the tenement dwellers of this great city. The housewives of New York have been trained by hard experience on the economical use of meat. What we want is the help of your department on the meat profiteers who are keeping the hard-working people of this city from obtaining proper nourishment.

During the presidencies of Harding and Coolidge in the twenties, the Secretary of the Treasury was Andrew Mellon, one of the richest men in America. In 1923, Congress was presented with the ""Mellon Plan,"" calling for what looked like a general reduction of income taxes, except that the top income brackets would have their tax rates lowered from 50 percent to 25 percent, while the lowest-income group would have theirs lowered from 4 percent to 3 percent. A few Congressmen from working-class districts spoke against the bill, like William P. Connery of Massachusetts:

I am not going to have my people who work in the shoe factories of Lynn and in the mills in Lawrence and the leather industry of Peabody, in these days of so-called Republican prosperity when they are working but three days in the week think that I am in accord with the provisions of this bill. . .. When I see a provision in this Mellon tax bill which is going to save Mr. Mellon himself $800,000 on his income tax and his brother $600,000 on his, I cannot give it my support.

The Mellon Plan passed. In 1928, La Guardia toured the poorer districts of New York and said: ""I confess I was not prepared for what I actually saw. It seemed almost incredible that such conditions of poverty could really exist.""

Buried in the general news of prosperity in the twenties were, from time to time, stories of bitter labor struggles. In 1922, coal miners and railroad men went on strike, and Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana, a Progressive elected with labor votes, visited the strike area and reported:

All day long I have listened to heartrending stories of women evicted from their homes by the coal companies. I heard pitiful pleas of little children crying for bread. I stood aghast as I heard most amazing stories from men brutally beaten by private policemen. It has been a shocking and nerve- racking experience.

A textile strike in Rhode Island in 1922 among Italian and Portuguese workers failed, but class feelings were awakened and some of the strikers joined radical movements. Luigi Nardella recalled:

... my oldest brother, Guido, he started the strike. Guido pulled the handles on the looms in the Royal Mills, going from one section to the next shouting, ""Strike! Strike!"" . . . When the strike started we didn't have any union organizers... .. We got together a group of girls and went from mill to mill, and that morning we got five mills out. We'd motion to the girls in the mills, ""Come out! Come out!"" Then we'd go on to the next. . . .

Somebody from the Young Workers' League came out to bring a check, and invited me to a meeting, and I went. Then I joined, and in a few years I was in the Risorgimento Club in Providence. We were anti-Fascists. I spoke on street corners, bring a stand, jump up and talk to good crowds. And we led the support for Sacco and Vanzetti.. . .

After the war, with the Socialist party weakened, a Communist party was organized, and Communists were involved in the organization of the Trade Union Education League, which tried to build a militant spirit inside the AFL. When a Communist named Ben Gold, of the furriers' section of the TUEL, challenged the AFL union leadership at a meeting, he was knifed and beaten. In 1926, he and other Communists organized a strike of furriers who formed mass picket lines, battled the police to hold their lines, were arrested and beaten, but kept striking, until they won a forty-hour week and a wage increase.

Communists again played a leading part in the great textile strike that spread through the Carolinas and Tennessee in the spring of 1929. The mill owners had moved to the South to escape unions, to find more subservient workers among the poor whites. But these workers rebelled against the long hours, the low pay. They particularly resented the ""stretch-out""-an intensification of work. For instance, -a weaver who had operated twenty-four looms and got $18.91 a week would be raised to $23, but he would be ""stretched out"" to a hundred looms and had to work at a punishing pace.

The first of the textile strikes was in Tennessee, where five hundred women in one mill walked out in protest against wages of $9 to $10 a week. Then at Gastonia, North Carolina, workers joined a new union, the National Textile Workers Union, led by Communists, which admitted both blacks and whites to membership. When some of them were fired, half of the two thousand workers went out on strike. An atmosphere of anti-Communism and racism built up and violence began. Textile strikes began to spread across South Carolina.

One by one the various strikes were settled, with some gains, but not at Gastonia. There, with the textile workers living in a tent colony, and refusing to renounce the Communists in their leadership, the strike went on. But strikebreakers were brought in and the mills kept operating. Desperation grew; there were violent clashes with the police. One dark night, the chief of police was killed in a gun battle and sixteen strikers and sympathizers were indicted for murder, including Fred Real, a Communist party organizer. Ultimately seven were tried and given sentences of from five to twenty years. They were released on bail, and left the state; the Communists escaped to Soviet Russia. Through all the defeats, the beatings, the murders, however, it was the beginning of textile mill unionism in the South.

The stock market crash of 1929, which marked the beginning of the Great Depression of the United States, came directly from wild speculation which collapsed and brought the whole economy down with it. But, as John Galbraith says in his study of that event (The Great Crash), behind that speculation was the fact that ""the economy was fundamentally unsound."" He points to very unhealthy corporate and banking structures, an unsound foreign trade, much economic misinformation, and the ""bad distribution of income"" (the highest 5 percent of the population received about one-third of all personal income).

A socialist critic would go further and say that the capitalist system was by its nature unsound: a system driven by the one overriding motive of corporate profit and therefore unstable, unpredictable, and blind to human needs. The result of all that: permanent depression for many of its people, and periodic crises for almost everybody. Capitalism, despite its attempts at self-reform, its organization for better control, was still in 1929 a sick and undependable system.

After the crash, the economy was stunned, barely moving. Over five thousand banks closed and huge numbers of businesses, unable to get money, closed too. Those that continued laid off employees and cut the wages of those who remained, again and again. Industrial production fell by 50 percent, and by 1933 perhaps 15 million (no one knew exactly)- one-fourth or one-third of the labor force-were out of work. The Ford Motor Company, which in the spring of 1929 had employed 128,000 workers, was down to 37,000 by August of 1931. By the end of 1930, almost half the 280,000 textile mill workers in New England were out of work. Former President Calvin Coolidge commented with his customary wisdom: ""When more and more people are thrown out of work, unemployment results."" He spoke again in early 1931, ""This country is not in good condition.""

Clearly those responsible for organizing the economy did not know what had happened, were baffled by it, refused to recognize it, and found reasons other than the failure of the system. Herbert Hoover had said, not long before the crash: ""We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land."" Henry Ford, in March 1931, said the crisis was here because ""the average man won't really do a day's work unless he is caught and cannot get out of it. There is plenty of work to do if people would do it."" A few weeks later he laid off 75,000 workers.

There were millions of tons of food around, but it was not profitable to transport it, to sell it. Warehouses were full of clothing, but people could not afford it. There were lots of houses, but they stayed empty because people couldn't pay the rent, had been evicted, and now lived in shacks in quickly formed ""Hoovervilles"" built on garbage dumps.

Brief glimpses of reality in the newspapers could have been multiplied by the millions: A New York Times story in early 1932:

After vainly trying to get a stay of dispossession until January 15 from his apartment at 46 Hancock Street in Brooklyn, yesterday, Peter J. Cornell, 48 years old, a former roofing contractor out of work and penniless, fell dead in the arms of his wife.

A doctor gave the cause of his death as heart disease, and the police said it had at least partly been caused by the bitter disappointment of a long day's fruitless attempt to prevent himself and his family being put out on the street... .

Cornell owed $5 in rent in arrears and $39 for January which his landlord required in advance. Failure to produce the money resulted in a dispossess order being served on the family yesterday and to take effect at the end of the week.

After vainly seeking assistance elsewhere, he was told during the day by the Home Relief Bureau that it would have no funds with which to help him until January 15.

A dispatch from Wisconsin to The Nation, in late 1932:

Throughout the middle west the tension between the farmers and authorities has been growing ... as a result of tax and foreclosure sales. In many cases evictions have been prevented only by mass action on the part of the farmers. However, until the Cichon homestead near Elkhorn, Wisconsin, was besieged on December 6 by a host of deputy sheriffs armed with machine-guns, rifles, shotguns, and tear-gas bombs, there had been no actual violence. Max Cichon's property was auctioned off at a foreclosure sale last August, but he refused to allow either the buyer or the authorities to approach his home. He held off unwelcome visitors with a shotgun. The sheriff called upon Cichon to submit peacefully. When he refused to do so, the sheriff ordered deputies to lay down a barrage of machine-gun and rifle fire . . . Cichon is now in jail in Elkhorn, and his wife and two children, who were with him in the house, are being cared for in the county hospital. Cichon is not a trouble-maker. He enjoys the confidence of his neighbors, who only recently elected him justice of the peace of the town of Sugar Creek. That a man of his standing and disposition should go to such lengths in defying the authorities is a clear warning that we may expect further trouble in the agricultural districts unless the farmers are soon helped.

A tenement dweller on 113th Street in East Harlem wrote to Congressman Fiorello La Guardia in Washington:

You know my condition is bad. I used to get pension from the government and they stopped. It is now nearly seven months I am out of work. I hope you will try to do something for me.. .. I have four children who are in need of clothes and food.. .. My daughter who is eight is very ill and not recovering. My rent is due two months and I am afraid of being put out.

In Oklahoma, the farmers found their farms sold under the auctioneer's hammer, their farms turning to dust, the tractors coming in and taking over. John Steinbeck, in his novel of the depression, The Grapes of Wrath, describes what happened:

And the dispossessed, the migrants, flowed into California, two hundred and fifty thousand, and three hundred thousand. Behind them new tractors were going on the land and the tenants were being forced off. And new waves were on the way, new waves of the dispossessed and the homeless, hard, intent, and dangerous. . ..

And a homeless hungry man, driving the road with his wife beside him and his thin children in the back seat, could look at the fallow fields which might produce food but not profit, and that man could know how a fallow field is a sin and the unused land a crime against the thin children.. . .

And in the south he saw the golden oranges hanging on the trees, the little golden oranges on the dark green trees; and guards with shotguns patrolling the lines so a man might not pick an orange for a thin child, oranges to be dumped if the price was low. . , .

These people were becoming ""dangerous,"" as Steinbeck said. The spirit of rebellion was growing. Mauritz Hallgren, in a 1933 book, Seeds of Revolt, compiled newspaper reports of things happening around the country:

England, Arkansas, January 3, 1931. The long drought that ruined hundreds of Arkansas farms last summer had a dramatic sequel late today when some 500 farmers, most of them white men and many of them armed, marched on the business section of this town. .. . Shouting that they must have food for themselves and their families, the invaders announced their intention to take it from the stores unless it were provided from some other source without cost.

Detroit, July 9, 1931. An incipient riot by 500 unemployed men turned out of the city lodging house for lack of funds was quelled by police reserves in Cadillac Square tonight. . ..

Indiana Harbor, Indiana, August 5, 1931. Fifteen hundred jobless men stormed the plant of the Fruit Growers Express Company here, demanding that they be given jobs to keep from starving. The company's answer was to call the city police, who routed the jobless with menacing clubs.

Boston, November 10, 1931. Twenty persons were treated for injuries, three were hurt so seriously that they may die, and dozens of others were nursing wounds from flying bottles, lead pipe, and stones after clashes between striking longshoremen and Negro strikebreakers along the Charlestown-East Boston waterfront.

Detroit, November 28, 1931. A mounted patrolman was hit on the head with a stone and unhorsed and one demonstrator was arrested during a disturbance in Grand Circus Park this morning when 2000 men and women met there in defiance of police orders.

Chicago, April 1, 1932. Five hundred school children, most with haggard faces and in tattered clothes, paraded through Chicago's downtown section to the Board of Education offices to demand that the school system provide them with food.

Boston, June 3, 1932. Twenty-five hungry children raided a buffet lunch set up for Spanish War veterans during a Boston parade. Two automobile-loads of police were called to drive them away.

New York, January 21, 1933. Several hundred jobless surrounded a restaurant just off Union Square today demanding they be fed without charge.. . .

Seattle, February 16, 1933. A two-day siege of the County-City Building, occupied by an army of about 5,000 unemployed, was ended early tonight, deputy sheriffs and police evicting the demonstrators after nearly two hours of efforts.

Yip Harburg, the songwriter, told Studs Terkel about the year 1932: ""I was walking along the street at that time, and you'd see the bread lines. The biggest one in New York City was owned by William Randolph Hearst. He had a big truck with several people on it, and big cauldrons of hot soup, bread. Fellows with burlap on their feet were lined up all around Columbus Circle, and went for blocks and blocks around the park, waiting."" Harburg had to write a song for the show Americana. He wrote ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?""

Once in khaki suits.

Gee, we looked swell,

Full of that Yankee Doodle-de-dum.

Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell,

I was the kid with the drum.

Say, don't you remember, they called me Al-

It was Al all the time.

Say, don't you remember I'm your pal-

Brother, can you spare a dime?

It was not just a song of despair. As Yip Harburg told Terkel:

In the song the man is really saying: I made an investment in this country. Where the hell are my dividends? ... It's more than just a bit of pathos. It doesn't reduce him to a beggar. It makes him a dignified human, asking questions-and a bit outraged, too, as he should be.

The anger of the veteran of the First World War, now without work, his family hungry, led to the march of the Bonus Army to Washington in the spring and summer of 1932. War veterans, holding government bonus certificates which were due years in the future, demanded that Congress pay off on them now, when the money was desperately needed. And so they began to move to Washington from all over the country, with wives and children or alone. They came in broken-down old autos, stealing rides on freight trains, or hitchhiking. They were miners from West Virginia, sheet metal workers from Columbus, Georgia, and unemployed Polish veterans from Chicago. One family- husband, wife, three-year-old boy-spent three months on freight trains coming from California. Chief Running Wolf, a jobless Mescalero Indian from New Mexico, showed up in full Indian dress, with bow and arrow.

More than twenty thousand came. Most camped across the Potomac River from the Capitol on Anacostia Flats where, as John Dos Passos wrote, ""the men are sleeping in little lean-tos built out of old newspapers, cardboard boxes, packing crates, bits of tin or tarpaper roofing, every kind of cockeyed makeshift shelter from the rain scraped together out of the city dump."" The bill to pay off on the bonus passed the House, but was defeated in the Senate, and some veterans, discouraged, left. Most stayed-some encamped in government buildings near the Capitol, the rest on Anacostia Flats, and President Hoover ordered the army to evict them.

Four troops of cavalry, four companies of infantry, a machine gun squadron, and six tanks assembled near the White House. General Douglas MacArthur was in charge of the operation, Major Dwight Eisenhower his aide. George S. Patton was one of the officers. MacArthur led his troops down Pennsylvania Avenue, used tear gas to clear veterans out of the old buildings, and set the buildings on fire. Then the army moved across the bridge to Anacostia. Thousands of veterans, wives, children, began to run as the tear gas spread. The soldiers set fire to some of the huts, and soon the whole encampment was ablaze. When it was all over, two veterans had been shot to death, an eleven-week-old baby had died, an eight-year-old boy was partially blinded by gas, two police had fractured skulls, and a thousand veterans were injured by gas.

The hard, hard times, the inaction of the government in helping, the action of the government in dispersing war veterans-all had their effect on the election of November 1932. Democratic party candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover overwhelmingly, took office in the spring of 1933, and began a program of reform legislation which became famous as the ""New Deal."" When a small veterans' march on Washington took place early in his administration, he greeted them and provided coffee; they met with one of his aides and went home. It was a sign of Roosevelt's approach.

The Roosevelt reforms went far beyond previous legislation. They had to meet two pressing needs: to reorganize capitalism in such a way to overcome the crisis and stabilize the system; also, to head off the alarming growth of spontaneous rebellion in the early years of the Roosevelt administration- organization of tenants and the unemployed, movements of self-help, general strikes in several cities.

That first objective-to stabilize the system for its own protection- was most obvious in the major law of Roosevelt's first months in office, the National Recovery Act (NRA). It was designed to take control of the economy through a series of codes agreed on by management, labor, and the government, fixing prices and wages, limiting competition. From the first, the NRA was dominated by big businesses and served their interests. As Bernard Bellush says (The Failure of the N.R.A.), its Title I, it turned much of the nation's power over to highly organized, well-financed trade associations and industrial combines. The unorganized public, otherwise known as the consumer, along with the members of the fledgling trade-union movement, had virtually nothing to say about the initial organization of the National Recovery Administration, or the formulation of basic policy.""

Where organized labor was strong, Roosevelt moved to make some concessions to working people. But: ""Where organized labor was weak, Roosevelt was unprepared to withstand the pressures of industrial spokesmen to control the . . . NRA codes."" Barton Bernstein (Towards a New Past) confirms this: ""Despite the annoyance of some big businessmen with Section 7a, the NRA reaffirmed and consolidated their power. . . ."" Bellush sums up his view of the NRA:

The White House permitted the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, and allied business and trade associations to assume overriding authority... . Indeed, private administration became public administration, and private government became public government, insuring the marriage of capitalism with statism.

When the Supreme Court in 1935 declared the NRA unconstitutional, it claimed it gave too much power to the President, but, according to Bellush, "". . . FDR surrendered an inordinate share of the power of government, through the NRA, to industrial spokesmen throughout the country.""

Also passed in the first months of the new administration, the AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Administration) was an attempt to organize agriculture. It favored the larger farmers as the NRA favored big business. The TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) was an unusual entrance of government into business-a government-owned network of dams and hydroelectric plants to control floods and produce electric power in the Tennessee Valley. It gave jobs to the unemployed, helped the consumer with lower electric rates, and in some respect deserved the accusation that it was ""socialistic."" But the New Deal's organization of the economy was aimed mainly at stabilizing the economy, and secondly at giving enough help to the lower classes to keep them from turning a rebellion into a real revolution.

That rebellion was real when Roosevelt took office:. Desperate people were not waiting for the government to help them; they were helping themselves, acting directly. Aunt Molly Jackson, a woman who later became active in labor struggles in Appalachia, recalled how she walked into the local store, asked for a 24-pound sack of flour, gave it to her little boy to take it outside, then filled a sack of sugar and said to the storekeeper, ""Well, I'll see you in ninety days. I have to feed some children . . . I'll pay you, don't worry."" And when he objected, she pulled out her pistol (which, as a midwife traveling alone through the hills, she had a permit to carry) and said: ""Martin, if you try to take this grub away from me, God knows that if they electrocute me for it tomorrow, I'll shoot you six times in a minute."" Then, as she recalls, ""I walked out, I got home, and these seven children was so hungry that they was a-grabbin the raw dough off-a their mother's hands and crammin it into their mouths and swallowing it whole.""

All over the country, people organized spontaneously to stop evictions, in New York, in Chicago, in other cities-when word spread that someone was being evicted, a crowd would gather; the police would remove the furniture from the house, put it out in the street, and the crowd would bring the furniture back. The Communist party was active in organizing Workers Alliance groups in the cities. Mrs. Willye Jeffries, a black woman, told Studs Terkel about evictions:

A lot of 'em was put out. They'd call and have the bailiffs come and sit them out, and as soon as they'd leave, we would put 'em back where they came out. All we had to do was call Brother Hilton. .. . Look, such and such a place, there's a family sittin' out there. Everybody passed through the neighborhood, was a member of the Workers Alliance, had one person they would call. When that one person came, he'd have about fifty people with him... . Take that stuff right on back up there. The men would connect those lights and go to the hardware and get gas pipe, and connect that stove back. Put the furniture back just like you had it, so it don't look like you been out the door.

Unemployed Councils were formed all over the country. They were described by Charles R. Walker, writing in The Forum in 1932:

I find it is no secret that Communists organize Unemployed Councils in most cities and usually lead them, but the councils are organized democratically and the majority rules. In one I visited at Lincoln Park, Michigan, there were three hundred members of which eleven were Communists... . The Council had a right wing, a left wing, and a center. The chairman of the Council ... was also the local commander of the American Legion. In Chicago there are 45 branches of the Unemployed Council, with a total membership of 22,000.

The Council's weapon is democratic force of numbers, and their function is to prevent evictions of the destitute, or if evicted to bring pressure to bear on the Relief Commission to find a new home; if an unemployed worker has his gas or his water turned off because he can't pay for it, to see the proper authorities; to see that the unemployed who are shoeless and clothesless get both; to eliminate through publicity and pressure discriminations between Negroes and white persons, or against the foreign born, in matters of relief ... to march people down to relief headquarters and demand they be fed and clothed. Finally to provide legal defense for all unemployed arrested for joining parades, hunger marches, or attending union meetings.

People organized to help themselves, since business and government were not helping them in 1931 and 1932. In Seattle, the fishermen's union caught fish and exchanged them with people who picked fruit and vegetables, and those who cut wood exchanged that. There were twenty-two locals, each with a commissary where food and firewood were exchanged for other goods and services: barbers, seamstresses, and doctors gave of their skills in return for other things. By the end of 1932, there were 330 self-help organizations in thirty-seven states, with over 300,000 members. By early 1933, they seem to have collapsed; they were attempting too big a job in an economy that was more and more a shambles.

Perhaps the most remarkable example of self-help took place in the coal district of Pennsylvania, where teams of unemployed miners dug small mines on company property, mined coal, trucked it to cities, and sold it below the commercial rate. By 1934, 5 million tons of this ""bootleg"" coal were produced by twenty thousand men using four thousand vehicles. When attempts were made to prosecute, local juries would not convict, local jailers would not imprison.

These were simple actions, taken out of practical need, but they had revolutionary possibilities. Paul Mattick, a Marxist writer, commented:

All that is really necessary for the workers to do in order to end their miseries is to perform such simple things as to take from where there is, without regard to established property principles or social philosophies, and to start to produce for themselves. Done on a broad social scale, it will lead to lasting results; on a local, isolated plane it will be ... defeated. ... The bootleg miners have shown in a rather clear and impressive way, that the so-much bewailed absence of a socialist ideology on the part of the workers really does not prevent workers from acting quite anticapitalistically, quite in accordance with their own needs. Breaking through the confines of private property in order to live up to their own necessities, the miners' action is, at the same time a manifestation of the most important part of class consciousness- namely, that the problems of the workers can be solved only by themselves.

Were the New Dealers-Roosevelt and his advisers, the businessmen who supported him-also class- conscious? Did they understand that measures must be quickly taken, in 1933 and 1934, to give jobs, food baskets, relief, to wipe out the idea ""that the problems of the workers can be solved only by themselves""? Perhaps, like the workers' class consciousness, it was a set of actions arising not from held theory, but from instinctive practical necessity.

Perhaps it was such a consciousness that led to the Wagner-Connery Bill, introduced in Congress in early 1934, to regulate labor disputes. The bill provided elections for union representation, a board to settle problems and handle grievances. Was this not exactly the kind of legislation to do away with the idea that ""the problems of the workers can be solved only by themselves""? Big business thought it was too helpful to labor and opposed it. Roosevelt was cool to it. But in the year 1934 a series of labor outbursts suggested the need for legislative action.

A million and a half workers in different industries went on strike in 1934. That spring and summer, longshoremen on the West Coast, in a rank-and-file insurrection against their own union leadership as well as against the shippers, held a convention, demanded the abolition of the shape- up (a kind of early-morning slave market where work gangs were chosen for the day), and went out on strike.

Two thousand miles of Pacific coastline were quickly tied up. The teamsters cooperated, refusing to truck cargo to the piers, and maritime workers joined the strike. When the police moved in to open the piers, the strikers resisted en masse, and two were killed by police gunfire. A mass funeral procession for the strikers brought together tens of thousands of supporters. And then a general strike was called in San Francisco, with 130,000 workers out, the city immobilized.

Five hundred special police were sworn in and 4,500 National Guardsmen assembled, with infantry, machine gun, tank and artillery units. The Los Angeles Times wrote:

The situation in San Francisco is not correctly described by the phrase ""general strike."" What is actually in progress there is an insurrection, a Communist-inspired and -led revolt against organized government. There is but one thing to be done-put down the revolt with any force necessary.

The pressure became too strong. There were the troops. There was the AFL pushing to end the strike. The longshoremen accepted a compromise settlement. But they had shown the potential of a general strike.

That same summer of 1934, a strike of teamsters in Minneapolis was supported by other working people, and soon nothing was moving in the city except milk, ice, and coal trucks given exemptions by the strikers. Farmers drove their products into town and sold them directly to the people in the city. The police attacked and two strikers were killed. Fifty thousand people attended a mass funeral. There was an enormous protest meeting and a march on City Hall. After a month, the employers gave in to the teamsters' demands.

In the fall of that same year, 1934, came the largest strike of all- 325,000 textile workers in the South. They left the mills and set up flying squadrons in trucks and autos to move through the strike areas, picketing, battling guards, entering the mills, unbelting machinery. Here too, as in the other cases, the strike impetus came from the rank and file, against a reluctant union leadership at the top. The New York Times said: ""The grave danger of the situation is that it will get completely out of the hands of the leaders.""

Again, the machinery of the state was set in motion. Deputies and armed strikebreakers in South Carolina fired on pickets, killing seven, wounding twenty others. But the strike was spreading to New England. In Lowell, Massachusetts, 2,500 textile workers rioted; in Saylesville, Rhode Island, a crowd of five thousand people defied state troopers who were armed with machine guns, and shut down the textile mill. In Woonsocket, Rhode Island, two thousand people, aroused because someone had been shot and killed by the National Guard, stormed through the town and closed the mill.

By September 18, 421,000 textile workers were on strike throughout the country. There were mass arrests, organizers were beaten, and the death toll rose to thirteen. Roosevelt now stepped in and set up a board of mediation, and the union called off the strike.

In the rural South, too, organizing took place, often stimulated by Communists, but nourished by the grievances of poor whites and blacks who were tenant farmers or farm laborers, always in economic difficulties but hit even harder by the Depression. The Southern Tenant Farmers Union started in Arkansas, with black and white sharecroppers, and spread to other areas. Roosevelt's AAA was not helping the poorest of farmers; in fact by encouraging farmers to plant less, it forced tenants and sharecroppers to leave the land. By 1935, of 6,800,000 farmers, 2,800,000 were tenants. The average income of a sharecropper was $312 a year. Farm laborers, moving from farm to farm, area to area, no land of their own, in 1933 were earning about $300 a year.

Black farmers were the worst off, and some were attracted to the strangers who began appearing in their area during the Depression, suggesting they organize. Nate Shaw recalls, in Theodore Rosengarten's remarkable interview (All God's Dangers):

And durin of the pressure years, a union begin to operate in this country, called it the Sharecroppers Union-that was a nice name, I thought. '.. and I knowed what was goin on was a turnabout or the southern man, white and colored; it was somethin unusual. And I heard about it bein a organization for the poor class of people-that's just what I wanted to get into, too. I wanted to know the secrets of it enough that I could become in the knowledge of it... .

Mac Sloane, white man, said ""You stay out of it. These niggers runnin around here carryin on some kind of meetin-you better stay out of it.""

I said to myself, ""You a fool if you think you can keep me from joinin"". I went right on and joined it, just as quick as the next meetin come.. .. And he done just the thing to push me into it-gived me orders not to join.

The teachers of this organization begin to drive through this country- they couldn't let what they was doin be known. One of em was a colored fella; I disremember his name but he did a whole lot of time, holdin meetins with us-that was part of this job... .

Had the meetins at our houses or anywhere we could keep a look and a watch-out that nobody was comin in on us. Small meetins, sometimes there'd be a dozen ... niggers was scared, niggers was scared, that's tellin the truth.

Nate Shaw told of what happened when a black farmer who hadn't paid his debts was about to be dispossessed:

The deputy said, ""I'm goin to take all old Virgil Jones got this morning."" .. .

I begged him not to do it, begged him. ""You'll dispossess him of bein able to feed his family.""

Nate Shaw then told the deputy he was not going to allow it. The deputy came back with more men, and one of them shot and wounded Shaw, who then got his gun and fired back. He was arrested in late 1932, and served twelve years in an Alabama prison. His story is a tiny piece of the great unrecorded drama of the southern poor in those years of the Sharecroppers Union. Years after his release from prison, Nate Shaw spoke his mind on color and class:

O, it's plain as your hand. The poor white man and the poor black man is sittin in the same saddle today-big dudes done branched em off that way. The control of a man, the controllin power, is in the hands of the rich man, . .. That class is standin together and the poor white man is out there on the colored list-I've caught that: ways and actions a heap of times speaks louder than words. .. .

Hosea Hudson, a black man from rural Georgia, at the age of ten a plowhand, later an iron worker in Birmingham, was aroused by the case of the Scottsboro Boys in 1931 (nine black youths accused of raping two white girls and convicted on flimsy evidence by all-white juries). That year he joined the Communist party. In 1932 and 1933, he organized unemployed blacks in Birmingham. He recalls:

Deep in the winter of 1932 we Party members organized a unemployed mass meeting to be held on the old courthouse steps, on 3rd Avenue, North Birmingham.... It was about 7000 or more people turned out.. . Negroes and whites. .. .

In 1932 and '33 we began to organize these unemployed block committees in the various communities of Birmingham.... If someone get out of food. . .. We wouldn't go around and just say, ""That's too bad"". We make it our business to go see this person. .. . And if the person was willing ... we'd work with them. ...

Block committees would meet every week, had a regular meeting. We talked about the welfare question, what was happening, we read the Daily Worker and the Southern Worker to see what was going on about unemployed relief, what people doing in Cleveland . . . struggles in Chicago ... or we talk about the latest developments in the Scottsboro case. We kept up, we was on top, so people always wanted to come cause we had something different to tell them every time.

In 1934 and 1935 hundreds of thousands of workers, left out of the rightly controlled, exclusive unions of the American Federation of Labor, began organizing in the new mass production industries-auto, rubber, packinghouse. The AFL could not ignore them; it set up a Committee for Industrial Organization to organize these workers outside of craft lines, by industry, all workers in a plant belonging to one union. This Committee, headed by John Lewis, then broke away and became the CIO-the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

But it was rank-and-file strikes and insurgencies that pushed the union leadership, AFL and CIO, into action. Jeremy Brecher tells the story in his book Strike! A new kind of tactic began among rubber workers in Akron, Ohio, in the early thirties - the sit-down strike. The workers stayed in the plant instead of walking out, and this had clear advantages: they were directly blocking the use of strikebreakers; they did not have to act through union officials but were in direct control of the situation themselves; they did not have to walk outside in the cold and rain, but had shelter; they were not isolated, as in their work, or on the picket line; they were thousands under one roof, free to talk to one another, to form a community of struggle. Louis Adamic, a labor writer, describes one of the early sit-downs:

Sitting by their machines, cauldrons, boilers and work benches, they talked. Some realized for the first time how important they were in the process of rubber production. Twelve men had practically stopped the works! .. . Superintendents, foremen, and straw bosses were dashing about... In less than an hour the dispute was settled, full victory for the men.

In early 1936, at the Firestone rubber plant in Akron, makers of truck tires, their wages already too low to pay for food and rent, were faced with a wage cut. When several union men were fired, others began to stop work, to sit down on the job. In one day the whole of plant #1 was sitting down. In two days, plant #2 was sitting down, and management gave in. In the next ten days there was a sit-down at Goodyear. A court issued an injunction against mass picketing. It was ignored, and ISO deputies were sworn in. But they soon faced ten thousand workers from all over Akron. In a month the strike was won.

The idea spread through 1936. In December of that year began the longest sit-down strike of all, at Fisher Body plant #1 in Flint, Michigan. It started when two brothers were fired, and it lasted until February 1937. For forty days there was a community of two thousand strikers. ""It was like war,"" one said. ""The guys with me became my buddies."" Sidney Fine in Sit-Down describes what happened. Committees organized recreation, information, classes, a postal service, sanitation. Courts were set up to deal with those who didn't take their turn washing dishes or who threw rubbish or smoked where it was prohibited or brought in liquor. The ""punishment"" consisted of extra duties; the ultimate punishment was expulsion from the plant. A restaurant owner across the street prepared three meals a day for two thousand strikers. There were classes in parliamentary procedure, public speaking, history of the labor movement. Graduate students at the University of Michigan gave courses in journalism and creative writing.

There were injunctions, but a procession of five thousand armed workers encircled the plant and there was no attempt to enforce the injunction. Police attacked with tear gas and the workers fought back with firehoses. Thirteen strikers were wounded by gunfire, but the police were driven back. The governor called out the National Guard. By this time the strike had spread to other General Motors plants. Finally there was a settlement, a six-month contract, leaving many questions unsettled but recognizing that from now on, the company would have to deal not with individuals but with a union.

In 1936 there were forty-eight sitdown strikes. In 1937 there were 477: electrical workers in St. Louis; shirt workers in Pulaski, Tennessee; broom workers in Pueblo, Colorado; trash collectors in Bridgeport, Connecticut; gravediggers in New Jersey; seventeen blind workers at the New York Guild for the Jewish Blind; prisoners in an Illinois penitentiary; and even thirty members of a National Guard Company who had served in the Fisher Body sit-down, and now sat down themselves because they had not been paid.

The sit-downs were especially dangerous to the system because they were not controlled by the regular union leadership. An AFL business agent for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees said:

You'd be sitting in the office any March day of 1937, and the phone would ring and the voice at the other end would say: ""My name is Mary Jones; I'm a soda clerk at Liggett's; we've thrown the manager out and we've got the keys. What do we do now?"" And you'd hurry over to the company to negotiate and over there they'd say, ""I think it's the height of irresponsibility to call a strike before you've ever asked for a contract"" and all you could answer was, ""You're so right.""

It was to stabilize the system in the face of labor unrest that the Wagner Act of 1935, setting up a National Labor Relations Board, had been passed. The wave of strikes in 1936, 1937, 1938, made the need even more pressing. In Chicago, on Memorial Day, 1937, a strike at Republic Steel brought the police out, firing at a mass picket line of strikers, killing ten of them. Autopsies showed the bullets had hit the workers in the back as they were running away: this was the Memorial Day Massacre. But Republic Steel was organized, and so was Ford Motor Company, and the other huge plants in steel, auto, rubber, meatpacking, the electrical industry.

The Wagner Act was challenged by a steel corporation in the courts, but the Supreme Court found it constitutional-that the government could regulate interstate commerce, and that strikes hurt interstate commerce. From the trade unions' point of view, the new law was an aid to union organizing. From the government's point of view it was an aid to the stability of commerce.

Unions were not wanted by employers, but they were more controllable-more stabilizing for the system than the wildcat strikes, the factory occupations of the rank and file. In the spring of 1937, a New York Times article carried the headline ""Unauthorized Sit-Downs Fought by CIO Unions."" The story read: ""Strict orders have been issued to all organizers and representatives that they will be dismissed if they authorize any stoppages of work without the consent of the international officers. .. ."" The Times quoted John L. Lewis, dynamic leader of the CIO: ""A CIO contract is adequate protection against sit-downs, lie-downs, or any other kind of strike.""

The Communist party, some of whose members played critical roles in organizing CIO unions, seemed to take the same position. One Communist leader in Akron was reported to have said at a party strategy meeting after the sit-downs: ""Now we must work for regular relations between the union and the employers-and strict observance of union procedure on the part of the workers.""

Thus, two sophisticated ways of controlling direct labor action developed in the mid-thirties. First, the National Labor Relations Board would give unions legal status, listen to them, settling certain of their grievances. Thus it could moderate labor rebellion by channeling energy into elections-just as the constitutional system channeled possibly troublesome energy into voting. The NLRB would set limits in economic conflict as voting did in political conflict. And second, the workers' organization itself, the union, even a militant and aggressive union like the CIO, would channel the workers' insurrectionary energy into contracts, negotiations, union meetings, and try to minimize strikes, in order to build large, influential, even respectable organizations.

The history of those years seems to support the argument of Richard Cloward and Frances Piven, in their book Poor People's Movements, that labor won most during its spontaneous uprisings, before the unions were recognized or well organized: ""Factory workers had their greatest influence, and were able to exact their most substantial concessions from government, during the Great Depression, in the years before they were organized into unions. Their power during the Depression was not rooted in organization, but in disruption.""

Piven and Cloward point out that union membership rose enormously in the forties, during the Second World War (the CIO and AFL had over 6 million members each by 1945), but its power was less than before-its gains from the use of strikes kept getting whittled down. The members appointed to the NLRB were less sympathetic to labor, the Supreme Court declared sit-downs to be illegal, and state governments were passing laws to hamper strikes, picketing, boycotts.

The coming of World War II weakened the old labor militancy of the thirties because the war economy created millions of new jobs at higher wages. The New Deal had succeeded only in reducing unemployment from 13 million to 9 million. It was the war that put almost everyone to work, and the war did something else: patriotism, the push for unity of all classes against enemies overseas, made it harder to mobilize anger against the corporations. During the war, the CIO and AFL pledged to call no strikes.

Still, the grievances of workers were such-wartime ""controls"" meant their wages were being controlled better than prices-that they felt impelled to engage in many wildcat strikes: there were more strikes in 1944 than in any previous year in American history, says Jeremy Brecher.

The thirties and forties showed more clearly than before the dilemma of working people in the United States. The system responded to workers' rebellions by finding new forms of control-internal control by their own organizations as well as outside control by law and force. But along with the new controls came new concessions. These concessions didn't solve basic problems; for many people they solved nothing. But they helped enough people to create an atmosphere of progress and improvement, to restore some faith in the system.

The minimum wage of 1938, which established the forty-hour week and outlawed child labor, left many people out of its provisions and set very low minimum wages (twenty-five cents an hour the first year). But it was enough to dull the edge of resentment. Housing was built for only a small percentage of the people who needed it. ""A modest, even parsimonious, beginning,"" Paul Conkin says (F.D.R. and the Origins of the Welfare State), but the sight of federally subsidized housing projects, playgrounds, vermin-free apartments, replacing dilapidated tenements, was refreshing. The TVA suggested exciting possibilities for regional planning to give jobs, improve areas, and provide cheap power, with local instead of national control. The Social Security Act gave retirement benefits and unemployment insurance, and matched state funds for mothers and dependent children-but it excluded farmers, domestic workers, and old people, and offered no health insurance. As Conkin says: ""The meager benefits of Social Security were insignificant in comparison to the building of security for large, established businesses.""

The New Deal gave federal money to put thousands of writers, artists, actors, and musicians to work-in a Federal Theatre Project, a Federal Writers Project, a Federal Art Project: murals were painted on public buildings; plays were put on for working-class audiences who had never seen a play; hundreds of books and pamphlets were written and published. People heard a symphony for the first time. It was an exciting flowering of arts for the people, such as had never happened before in American history, and which has not been duplicated since. But in 1939, with the country more stable and the New Deal reform impulse weakened, programs to subsidize the arts were eliminated.

When the New Deal was over, capitalism remained intact. The rich still controlled the nation's wealth, as well as its laws, courts, police, newspapers, churches, colleges. Enough help bad been given to enough people to make Roosevelt a hero to millions, but the same system that had brought depression and crisis-the system of waste, of inequality, of concern for profit over human need- remained.

For black people, the New Deal was psychologically encouraging (Mrs. Roosevelt was sympathetic; some blacks got posts in the administration), but most blacks were ignored by the New Deal programs. As tenant farmers, as farm laborers, as migrants, as domestic workers, they didn't qualify for unemployment insurance, minimum wages, social security, or farm subsidies. Roosevelt, careful not to offend southern white politicians whose political support he needed, did not push a bill against lynching. Blacks and whites were segregated in the armed forces. And black workers were discriminated against in getting jobs. They were the last hired, the first fired. Only when A. Philip Randolph, head of the Sleeping-Car Porters Union, threatened a massive march on Washington in 1941 would Roosevelt agree to sign an executive order establishing a Fair Employment Practices Committee. But the FEPC had no enforcement powers and changed little.

Black Harlem, with all the New Deal reforms, remained as it was. There 350,000 people lived, 233 persons per acre compared with 133 for the rest of Manhattan. In twenty-five years, its population had multiplied six times. Ten thousand families lived in rat-infested cellars and basements. Tuberculosis was common. Perhaps half of the married women worked as domestics. They traveled to the Bronx and gathered on street corners-""slave markets,"" they were called-to be hired, Prostitution crept in. Two young black women, Ella Baker and Marvel Cooke, wrote about this in The Crisis in 1935:

Not only is human labor bartered and sold for the slave wage, but human love is also a marketable commodity. Whether it is labor or love, the women arrive as early as eight a.m. and remain as late as one p.m. or until they are hired. In rain or shine, hot or cold, they wait to work for ten, fifteen, and twenty cents per hour.

In Harlem Hospital in 1932, proportionately twice as many people died as ill Bellvue Hospital, which was in the white area downtown. Harlem was a place that bred crime-""the bitter blossom of poverty,"" as Roi Ottley and William Weatherby say in their essay ""The Negro in New York.""

On March 19, 1935, even as the New Deal reforms were being passed, Harlem exploded. Ten thousand Negroes swept through the streets, destroying the property of white merchants. Seven hundred policemen moved in and brought order. Two blacks were killed.

In the mid-thirties, a young black poet named Langston Hughes wrote a poem, ""Let America Be America Again"":

... I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,

I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars.

I am the red man driven from the land,

I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek-

And finding only the same old stupid plan.

Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak... .

O, let America be America again-

The land that never has been yet-

And yet must be-the land where every man is free.

The land that's mine-the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's

ME-

Who made America,

Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,

Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,

Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose-

The steel of freedom does not stain.

From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,

We must take back our land again,

America! . . .

Americans of the thirties, however, North and South, blacks were invisible. Only the radicals made an attempt to break the racial barriers: Socialists, Trotskyists, Communists most of all. The CIO, influenced by the Communists, was organizing blacks in the mass production industries. Blacks were still being used as strikebreakers, but now there were also attempts to bring blacks and whites together against their common enemy. A woman named Mollie Lewis, writing in The Crisis, in 1938, told of her experience in a steel strike in Gary, Indiana:

While the municipal government of Gary continues to keep the children apart in a system of separate schools, their parents are getting together in the union and in the auxiliary. ... The only public eating place in Gary where both races may be freely served is a cooperative restaurant largely patronized by members of the union and auxiliary. . ..

When the black and white workers and members of their families are convinced that their basic economic interests are the same, they may be expected to make common cause for the advancement of these interests.. . .

There was no great feminist movement in the thirties. But many women became involved in the labor organizing of those years. A Minnesota poet, Meridel LeSeuer, was thirty-four when the great teamsters' strike tied up Minneapolis in 1934. She became active in it, and later described her experiences:

I have never been in a strike before. ... The truth is I was afraid. ... ""Do you need any help?"" I said eagerly.... We kept on pouring thousands of cups of coffee, feeding thousands of men... . The cars were coming back. The announcer cried, ""This is murder."" ... I saw them taking men out of cars and putting them on the hospital cots, on the floor. ... The picket cars keep coming in. Some men have walked back from the market, holding their own blood in.... Men, women and children are massing outside, a living circle close packed for protection. ,.. We have living blood on our skirts...

Tuesday, the day of the funeral, one thousand more militia were massed downtown.

It was over ninety in the shade. I went to the funeral parlors and thousands of men and women were massed there waiting in the terrific sun. One block of women and children were standing two hours waiting. I went over and stood near them. I didn't know whether I could march. I didn't like marching in parades. ... Three women drew me in. ""We want all to march,"" they said gently. ""Come with us."". . .

Sylvia Woods spoke to Alice and Staughton Lynd years later about her experiences in the thirties as a laundry worker and union organizer:

You have to tell people things they can see. Then they'll say, ""Oh, I never thought of that"" or ""I have never seen it like that,"" . .. Like Tennessee. He hated black people. A poor sharecropper. . . . he danced with a black woman.... So I have seen people change. This is the faith you've got to have in people.

Many Americans began to change their thinking in those days of crisis and rebellion. In Europe, Hitler was on the march. Across the Pacific, Japan was invading China. The Western empires were being threatened by new ones. For the United States, war was not far off.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

1 A PROLOGUE
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.

NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'

The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.
We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.

Over this:

VOICE #1 (o.s.)
Okay so what do you call yourself?
VOICE #2 (o.s.)
Como se llama?

MONTANA
Tony Montana...you?

VOICE #1
Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?

MONTANA
My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...

VOICE #1
So where's your old man now?

MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...

VOICE #1
Mother?

TONY
She's dead too.
VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?

TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....

TONY
(a beat)
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?

TONY
Me jail? No way.

We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.

MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?

TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.

MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?

TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?

MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.

The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.

TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.

MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?

TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.

His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.

MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?

TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.
(a grim chuckle)

MAN #3
And this?

He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word ""Madre""
scaled through it.

TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.

MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?

TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.

MAN #3
That's pretty funny, Tony.

TONY
Some Canadian tourist....

MAN #3
What'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!
(starts to walk out)

TONY
Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?

Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.

MAN #l
Carter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?

MAN #3
(walking out)
I... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.

TONY
Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.

Man #3 at the door stops, looks back.

TONY
Send me here, send me there. This.
That. Nothing you can do to me
Harry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....

That taunting smile on Tony's lips as, to the music of the
immigration theme, we:

The bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.
The windows are caged and we see INS guards.
The noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.

Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

MANNY
Seat's taken.

TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.

Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,

TONY
So what'd you tell them?

MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.

TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.

The bus pulling out now.

MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.

TONY
You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.

You did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.

DISSOLVE TO
8 INT. TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8

A movie projector...
...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....

The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

BOGART
What a thing.
Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.
Time to go to sleep.
(closes his eyes
but not for long)

CUT TO

9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9
Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.

TONY
That Bogart, Chico, hunh?

MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!

TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....

He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says ""Fuck Off and Die.""
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.

TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.

MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.

TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.

MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....

TONY
I know.

MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.

TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!

MANNY
Yeah, sure.

TONY
Hey, c'mon.

Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.

CHI-CHI
(to Manny; Spanish)
Hey Manny.

MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.

CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.

MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....

CHI-CHI
Want some new snatch? A pussycat
name of Yolanda just rolled onto the
Boulevard ---

MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?

CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.

MANNY
A real snatch?

CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.

As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. ""Later.""

He's in the middle of the ""Boulevard"" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.

He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a ""Viva Carter!"" proclamation in graffiti....

TRANSVESTITE
(passing)
What about you sugar -- you wanna party?

TONY
(passing her)
Yeah with whose cock, honey?

CUT TO

10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.

Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.

VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?

Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.

He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?

ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!

TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.

ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.

Manny catches up to Tony.

TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?

MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,

TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.

Angel comes over, listens.

MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!

TONY
Oh yeah?

MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.

TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.

MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.

ANGEL
Oh shit!

MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....

TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!

MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?

TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?

Tony winks and walks off.

The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.

TONY
(in awful imitation)
'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'

CUT TO

11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER


Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move
around a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.

TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....

The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.

MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!

Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.

ANGEL
(at a distance)
Hey Tony where ya going?

TONY
I got better things to do.

ANGEL
Chicken liver, hunh?

TONY
(to Manny)
Yeah?

(looking zd)
Let's walk.

They walk.

MANNY
You ready for the good news, cone?

TONY
Yeah.

MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?

TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?

Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.

MANNY
(shakes his head)
Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.

TONY
(enthusiastic)
Hey you're kidding, that's great!
But Manny, you tell your guys Angel gets out with us.

As Rebenga, in long-lensed closeup, nervously smokes a
cigarette, eyes roving as the guard examines his papers.

CUT TO
13 MONTAGE - THE RIOT - FREEDOMTOWN - DAY

The visuals are swift, dispassionate and documentary-like.
The refugees storm the barbed wire at the main gate,
carrying bricks and wooden slats.

ALL
(in unison)
Libertad! Libertad!

14 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND STATE POLICE
form ranks outside.

15 REFUGEES
flee through a hole in the fence.

16 GUARDS
move on them, wielding clubs.

17 SEVERAL REFUGEES
are scooting down a highway.

18 POLICE DOGS
on chains are glimpsed.

19 REFUGEES
throw stones and debris from the rooftop of a barrack.

20 REBENGA
a cigarette in his mouth, nervously hurries into a barrack.

21 ANGEL
tracks him, signals....

22 INSIDE - REFUGEES
are pulling apart their beds, going for the wooden slats.
Others set fire to their mattresses.

23 THE POLICE AND GUARDS
are moving through the gates, restoring order. Loudspeakers
blast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.

24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK
now goes up in flames.

25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.

Manny runs up on him.

Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.

Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.

TONY
Rebenga!

Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.

TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!

The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.

...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.

26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.

DISSOLVE TO

27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER

An Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.

It says ""ANTHONY MONTANA"" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.

End of montage. Music continues.

DISSOLVE TO

27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?""

Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.

TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?

MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.

TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
Millionaire.

MANNY
How do you know?

TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.

MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...

A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.

TONY
Hey baby what you say?

She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....

TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.

TONY
Come on?

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.

Tony walks over to him, mocking.

TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.

MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....

As they walk off, backs to camera.

TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?

MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.

CUT TO
28 LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT
on Southwest 8th Street. ""Calle Ocho""....

The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.

The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....

. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.

TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.

MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?

CUT TO

29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.

Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.

MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.

TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?

MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...

TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.
(looks at his hands)
Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.

His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.

COOK
(Spanish)
Hey you two, outside! You got company...

MANNY
That's him -- El Mono's here!

TONY
(contemptuous of the name)
El Mono? Shit....

CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- ""The Monkey"") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....

Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.

OMAR
I got something for you.

MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?

OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.

MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.

TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?

Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.

TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.

MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...

TONY
Shaddup!

Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.

OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?

TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.

Steps forward. Manny grabs him.

MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....

In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.

OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.

WALDO
What about them Indians ---

The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.

OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?

TONY
You kidding.

OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.

MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...

Tony says nothing.

OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?

MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.

OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...

MANNY
No problem.

OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.

Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.

TONY
I'm scared.

MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.

TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.

MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?

TONY
So what does it matter?

MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?

Tony strips off his greasy apron.

TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!

COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.

TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.

Throws the Cook his apron.

COOK
(Spanish)
What the fuck you gonna do!

TONY
Look after my investments.

CUT TO
31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.

The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.

32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.

Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.

MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!

At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.

CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.

MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....

Camera revealing the teenager.

TONY
(the light changing)
Drive, willya.

MANNY
(mocking)
Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?

ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.

MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?

ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.

As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.

MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,

CHI-CHI
Angel?

ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...

TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.

Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.

TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.

TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?

ANGEL
Sure thing.

As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:

TONY
Let's go....

CUT TO

33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked ""9"". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.

34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, ""The Toad"". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.

TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....

Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.

35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.

TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?

The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, ""The Lizard""; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.

The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?

Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.

TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

TOAD
I'm Hector...

Pause.

TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.

TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.

TONY
You know Omar.

TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.

TONY
Okay...

TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?

TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?

TOAD
Sure I got the stuff, but I don't
got it right here with me. I got it
close by.

TONY
Yeah well I don't got it either, I
got it close by, too.

TOAD
Where, in the parking lot?

TONY
No. How far's your stuff?

Tony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel
out... The Lizard staring at him...

TOAD
Not far.

Pause. Everything seems okay.

TONY
So what do we do, walk in and start over?

TOAD
(changes subject)
Where you from?

Tony's eyes check out the bathroom.

TONY
What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?

TOAD
I like to get to know who I do business with.

It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
move somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,
coiled and always watching.

TONY
You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.

TOAD
Hey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...

TONY
Okay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?

36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
commotion.

ANGEL
Tony!

Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
female shriek, like a bird.

LIZARD
(slang Spanish)
Don't! Get up! Now shithead!

She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.

The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
Columbians, ""The Kids"".

They slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.

As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

TONY
Frog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.

Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

TOAD
Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?

TONY
Try sticking your head up your ass.
See if it fits.

Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
pulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins
assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

CUT TO:

37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across
the street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.

38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
sees nothing, casually goes back in.

39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny looks at his watch.

CUT TO

40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

Tony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
bathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
Angel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're
dead and they know it.

Toad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.

TOAD
(to Tony)
You watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.

Lizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who
nods and turns on the whirring machine.

The Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly
towards Angel.

The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his
brains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

Lizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.

The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.

TOAD
Now the leg, hunh?

A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

CUT TO

41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with
Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They
signal and separate.

CUT TO

42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.

Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.

TOAD
Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.

He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
his blood, piss dead.

CUT TO

43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram
pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to
notice.

At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...

CUT TO

44 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - 'DAY
The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the
shower.

The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

TOAD
Last chance, carajo?

Tony, devastated, spits in his face.

TONY
Go fuck yourself.

Toad's eyes narrow meanly.

Kid one slaps the tape across Tony's mouth.

Kid two reaches up to tighten the overhead strap to Tony's
wrist.

The Toad turns on his chainsaw when suddenly there's a
gunshot from the hall.

45 INT./EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.

Manny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid
one, who is turning, in the neck.

Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.

The Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.

Manny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.

Manny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.

The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
him. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.

In sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.

Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.

In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

Chi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.

Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.

He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

Tony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.

TONY
I got him!

Manny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.

Chi-Chi sees Angel, gags.

CUT TO
46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46
The senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter
in astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

Their eyes follow.

As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
that counts. He stands behind the Toad.

TONY
(Spanish)
Your turn, cabron!

The Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.

Tony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.

The bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then
an old lady faints.

The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.

CUT TO

47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.

TONY
Manny, you okay?

Manny nods.

TONY
Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!

CHI-CHI
Si!

48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM
Tony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies
and busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which
the Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.

Inside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.

He shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.

CUT TO
49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony
hurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)

Past the senior citizens who are retreating inside their
rooms.

The camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars
come screaming past them from the opposite direction.

CUT TO
50 EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - PHONE BOOTH - DUSK
The booth is in the busy parking lot, Tony on the phone, Chi-Chi and Manny wait in the sedan.

TONY
Yeah, bunch of cowboys! ...somebody fucked up Omar.

OMAR'S VOICE
(shaken)
Look, let me check it out right away!

TONY
You do that, Omar, you do that.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the money?

TONY
Yeah -- and I got the yeyo.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the yeyo? Bring it here.

TONY
Fuck you. I'm taking it to the boss myself. Not you. Me.

OMAR'S VOICE
Okay, okay. All right. Frank's gonna wanna see you anyway. Look, meet me tonight at Hector's at eight.

TONY
Hey Omar...

OMAR'S VOICE
Yeah?

TONY
That was some pick up you sent us on.

Pause.

OMAR'S VOICE
What's that mean?

Tony hangs up, walks back to the sedan.

CUT TO

51 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - NIGHT
on Bricknell Avenue in a swank high-rise district adjacent
Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, the hub of South Miami...

The doorman shows Omar, Manny, his side bandaged, and Tony, carrying the suitcase, through giant glass portals, past seriously armed security cops in the lobby.

52 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52
A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?

TONY
Mr. Lopez... real pleasure.

LOPEZ
Call me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.

TONY
Okay Frank.

Frank shakes hands with Manny.

LOPEZ
Howya doing?

MANNY
(awed)
...Fine yeah.

TONY
Manny Ray, he was with us on the job.

LOPEZ
(to Manny)
I hear you caught one?

Manny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.

MANNY
Just the flesh. Went right through.

LOPEZ
(heading for the bar)
Yeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.

TONY
(glances at Omar)
Yeah. Omar's terrific.

LOPEZ
Not to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.

TONY
You don't have to mention it. That was fun.

LOPEZ
(smiles, likes the kid's balls)
Scotch? Gin? Rum?

TONY
Gin's fine.

LOPEZ
(pouring)
Yeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.

TONY
Yeah... well.

Still a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.

TONY
...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.
(produces the money)
It's my gift to you -- from me.

Pause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.

LOPEZ
It's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....

He glances hard at Omar who squirms.

Without opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes
the suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.

LOPEZ
Don't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!

They drink the toast. With their eyes.

LOPEZ
Then you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.
(drinks)

TONY
Yeah, I hope I have that problem someday.

Lopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.

LOPEZ
Where the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?

The big bodyguard exits smoothly.

LOPEZ
(to the others)
The broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.

TONY
I guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
Yeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?
(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)

TONY
Yeah sure, I could eat a horse.

ERNIE
Here she comes, Mr. Lopez.

TONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.

LOPEZ
Oooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.

She doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.

**ALTERNATIVE**
LOPEZ
Where you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.

ELVIRA
You're always hungry, you should try starving.

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana... Elvira... Manny Ribera.

ELVIRA
Hello.

TONY
Uh... hi.

MANNY
(equally impressed)
Yeah, hi.

ELVIRA
I assume we're going to be a fivesome.
Where are we having dinner?

FRANK
Oh, I thought we'd eat at the Babylon.

ELVIRA
Again? If anyone wanted to assassinate
you, you wouldn't be too hard to find.

LOPEZ
(coming toward her, laughing)
Me? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.

ELVIRA
You never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.

Neatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.

ELVIRA
Come on, Frank, let's go.

Tracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.

Lopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.

LOPEZ
Okay, let's go.

CUT TO
54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.

55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
The interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.

The crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
young, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, ""Celebrating"" or ""Partying Down Tonight"".

The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
and high heels.

Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
tough-looking tank tops with ""Motherfuckah"" and ""Fuck Me""
written on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.

MANNY
So whaddaya say, hunh?

He flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.

CHICK
You got a buck?

MANNY
Sure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?

CHICK
(indicates the machine)
Put it in, let's play.

MANNY
I had other things in mind.

CHICK
You check out on this and we'll talk about other things.

MANNY
(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)
Fuck, how do you play this thing?

CUT TO
56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56
Frank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug
of champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Over there that's Ronnie Echeverria.
Him and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....

Their point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.

LOPEZ
That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.

Their point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another
guy and gorgeous woman.

LOPEZ
...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....

Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.

LOPEZ
. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?

TONY
'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?

LOPEZ
It's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.

ELVIRA
Lesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.

The girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.

LOPEZ
That's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.
(eyeing Elvira)

HEAD WAITER
There you go, Mr. Lopez.

He's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.

LOPEZ
Give it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?

Head Waiter nods.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Five hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
In France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.

Tony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.

57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
A Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.

LOPEZ
Hey, George -- buddy.

MAN
Hey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?

The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.

LOPEZ
Oy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.

SHEFFIELD
Jack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.

LOPEZ
Yeah, almost everything.

SHEFFIELD
(to Elvira)
Elvira, you look terrific...
(to all)
Enjoy yourselves.

He ambles off.

LOPEZ
. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.

Tony looking off at him, remembering it.

LOPEZ
(raising his champagne glass)
So... here's to old friends...and new friends.

They toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.

LOPEZ
Well, Tony?

TONY
Hey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.

Lopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.

LOPEZ
(checking Tony's threads)
Yeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.

Omar doesn't like it but glances away.

TONY
Hey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.

The music shifts to slow dancing.

ELVIRA
(waving away cigar smoke)
So, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?

LOPEZ
Dance? I'd rather have a heart attack.

ELVIRA
(rising)
Don't foam into the Dom Perignon.

Glancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
How about you?

Tony nods sure, looks at his boss.

LOPEZ
(waves)
Go on!

They go.

58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.

LOPEZ
(to Omar)
What do you think?

OMAR
I think he's a fucking peasant.

LOPEZ
Yeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.

CUT TO
59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59
Tony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel
dance tune. He's no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in
the legs and shoulders.

TONY
...so what's your name, Elvira what?

ELVIRA
St. James.

TONY
Elvira St. James. Sounds like a nun or something. So where you from?

He bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.

ELVIRA
Baltimore...

TONY
Baltimore? Where's that?

ELVIRA
Look, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.

TONY
Just trying to be friendly.

ELVIRA
I've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.

He makes a point of looking at her.

TONY
Hey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.

ELVIRA
Oh, part of the Cuban crime wave?

Tony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.
The man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony
doesn't see.

TONY
Whatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?

ELVIRA
(interrupting)
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.

TONY
Why you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?

Elvira laughs at him, furious.

ELVIRA
You know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.

TONY
(interrupting)
Now you're talking to me, baby!

ELVIRA
First who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.

TONY
Hey, thataway.

She whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.

CUT TO

63 CAR - DAWN
Tony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.

They've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.

TONY
That chick he's with... she loves me.

MANNY
(driving)
Oh yeah, how you know that?

TONY
The eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.

MANNY
You're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.

TONY
What are you kidding -- he's soft.
I seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.

Pause.

63-A OMITTED

64 EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the
American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American
leaving Miami please bring the flag?""

Tony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.

TONY
I shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...

MANNY
I want a line of bluejeans with my name on the
chicks' asses.

TONY
Yeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,
We never gonna score the big money working for Frank.

MANNY
Frank's okay.

TONY
Yeah -- cause he buys you a suit? You thinkin' like
a chickenhead again

MANNY
Frank's got an organization.

TOW
Organization? I got more brains than Omar and he's bigger than me, That's not an organization. That`s a disorganization. What do you do for a brain man? Piss in it?

MANNY
Fuck you, somebody oughta shoot you, put you outta your misery
(seeing something)
Hey catch this tomato

Catching the eye of one of two young Girls passing, Manny
primps for them.

MANNY
Ooooh baby doll

TONY
Yeah, what do you girls say? you manna have some
ice cream with us somewhere?

They glance at Tony and Manny and hurry on.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin',

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you did know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
provoking Manny's laughter. Manny double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sengre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it...

TONY
Oooh ...cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.

Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.

TONY
Come on!

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.

Tony walks up to him, mocking.

TONY
I'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.
This country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls. Por Los cojonesl

MANNY
Hey Tony, last time this year you was in a fuckin' cage in Cuba. Why don't you take it easy Chico, slow down, one step at a time, be happy what you got you know? You get on your death bed you look around you think to yourself, when was I ever happy?

Camera moving with Tony as he glances in an elegant window displaying jewelry.

TONY
You be happy. I want what's comin' to me when I'm alive not when I'm dead.

MANNY (shakes his head)
Yeah, what's comin' to you Tony?

TONY
The world man, and everything in it.

As he goes into the store, the camera panning to the diamonds in the window.

CUT TO

65 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY
The house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.

66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY
From his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced
up and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of
gifts. Manny is at the wheel, curious.

TONY
Be back in an hour okay.

MANNY
Okay... be cool.

Tony approaches the house, with the paper bag held high against his chest.

67 EXT./INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
Tony's Mother opens the door.
A stout aging woman with a powerful face, she's shook to her roots.

TONY
(gently, in Spanish)
Mami... long time....

MAMS
No postcards from jail, hunh?

He doesn't offer to kiss her nor she him.

Pause.

Someone else is in the house. Mother looks behind her.
She opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.
He steps in. He looks.

68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.

TONY
(moved)
Hi Gina...

GINA
Tony?

She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
Tony's possession.)

TONY
(covering his unwanted emotion)
Yeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me! Yeah, so....

He holds out a wrapped gift towards her, about to give it.

TONY
I got this for you, no big deal but....

GINA
Oh Tony!

Gina suddenly. explodes across the room and rushes into his
arms, grasping him fiercely.

GINA
...it's you!

Tony, over her shoulder, catches his mother's eyes boring into him stonily.

GINA
I never thought I'd see you again -- never!

Tony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.

TONY
Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think they can keep a guy like me down?

Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.

TONY
...Yeah for you...and look -- here.
What I got written on it....
""To Gina From Tony. Always.""

GINA
It's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....

The mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls
out another present, for her.

TONY
...for you too Mama, look....

Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
exquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.

GINA
It's beautiful... Mama,
(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')

Mama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.

TONY
(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)
Well anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!

Tossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a
bottle of champagne.

TONY
Oye ! To America!
(singing)
'America. America....'

CUT TO
69 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mama, with things on her mind, is silently cooking a lunch,
as Tony and Gina finish the champagne at the kitchen table.

GINA
. . .So Mama's still at the factory and I'm working part-time at a beauty parlor. I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?

Tony nods.

GINA
It's his place. Plus I'm going to junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in two more years I get my cosmetology license and then I'll be making enough...

TONY
Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
with starting today. I didn't bring
up my kid sister to work in no hair
shop....

Mama looks over at him on the words ""bring up"" and he
catches her look.

TONY
...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.

He pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and
starts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,
looks.

TONY
(to Mama as he counts)
Yeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise
you. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.

Pushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.

TONY
That's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.

She approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the
bills, then looks back at her son.

MAMA
Who'd you kill for this Tony?

GINA
(aghast)
Mama!

TONY
I didn't kill nobody Mama,
(lying)

MAMA
No? What are you doing now -- banks or is it still bodegas, you and the others?

TONY
C'mon Mama. Things are different.
I'm working with this anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....

MAMA
Sure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face. All we read about in the papers is the animals like you and the killings, what about the Cubans who come here and work hard and make a good name for themselves? What about....

GINA
(springing to her feet)
What are you saying Mama! He's your son!

MAMA
Son? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a
bum now!
(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)
Who do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....

TONY
Hey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....

MAMA
(continuing)
No, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --
(emphasizing it)
I raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy
money with you, it stinks!

She casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him
like dead lettuce.

A silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.

GINA
Oh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.
(to Tony)
I'm sorry Tony, I....

Tony nods his head at his mother.

TONY
(gently)
Okay, Mama, okay....
CUT TO

70 EXT. TONY'S MOTHERS HOUSE - NIGHT 70

Tony walks out icily.

MANNY
(waiting in the car, seeing his expression)
Relatives, hunh? A pain in the ass,
they ---

TONY
Shaddup!

He's climbing into the car when Gina hurries out the house.

GINA
Tony!

MANNY
Hey who's that?
Checks himself in the rearview mirror, slicks his hair.

Tony and Gina talk next to the car.

GINA
Tony-.-Mama -- since Papa took off....

TONY
Hey forget Papa, we never had one, okay? He was a bum!

GINA
(continuing)
. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?

TONY
(making light of it now)
Hey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.

GINA
Tony, I know you did some bad things
back then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.

TONY
Communists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.

GINA
Mama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.

Pause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.

TONY
Hey I know... I know.

She gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.

TONY
Say, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?

She hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.

TONY
Go on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?

He gets in the car. She peers in.

GINA
You can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?

Her eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.
He smiles back with charm.

Gina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw. The sedan drives off.

71 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 71

MANNY
(driving)
cone, you -never told me you had
Hey,
such a good-looking doll for a sister!

Tony looks at him icily.
TONY
Stay away Manny, don't ever let me catch you fuckin' around with her, don't ever fuck around with her....

MANNY
(feeling heat)
Sure...sure.

A beat.
CUT TO

72 MONTAGE - PASSING TIME 72
Music accompanying the flipping of calendar leaves.

73 U.S. CUSTOMS - MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 73
Tony, spruce in his new three-piece suit with the diamond on
the finger and the expensive watch, looks like the young
ethnic American businessman in import-export as he steps in
front of a chunky, young Customs Officer, who looks at him coldly.

CUSTOMS OFFICER
Mind opening that, sir?

Tony, calm, unzips the chic leather single suitcase, his
eyes drifting around....
A woman, with a child and toy panda in a baby carriage, is cursorily checked through an adjacent line.
A nun is waived through the third line.
A stockbroker waiting in a fourth line, glances nervously in Tony's direction.
Tony looks away, back at the Officer who is thoroughly
ransacking the suitcase looking for a false bottom. He waits, confident.
An old man is waived through a fifth line,

75 EXT. DOLLY STASH'S HOUSE - MIAMI - DAY 75
The mother-type unscrews the handles of the baby carriage,
pulling out the wrapped cocaine, while Chi-Chi extricates
another load from the kid's panda bear which is now in
shreds.


76 THE OLD MAN 76
helped by Rafi, is removing a sophisticated false bottom
from his suitcase, laminated and difficult to detect.

77 MANNY AND GASPAR 77
break open wooden clothes hangers concealing cocaine as the stockbroker changes clothes.

78 THE MOTHER 78
picks up the baby and removes cocaine from its diaper.
While:

79 THE FORMER NUN 79
in partial habit, steps out of the toilet, adjusting her underpants; she places a package of cocaine on a table, on which we now see approximately five kilos stacked.

80 TONY 80
counting out the cash for his mules, Omar there, overlooking the operation.

81 MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 81
Again. But this time going out.

The nun, now a housewife, going through an exit gate carrying hand luggage.

82 TONY 82
watching, glances up at the electronic information board and the boarding gate--
Houston clocks out the time.-- we move to Los Angeles -- ""on time"" ---

Tony's eyes moving to the mother, now without the child,
buying her ticket at the counters.
Manny joins him, nodding okay.
Tony, with a glance at his watch, starts out the terminal.
The roar of the aircraft blending with city sounds as we continue the rapid pace of the montage with music.

86 EXT. GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86
Frank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.

87 INT. LAUNDRY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 87
The plush millionaire's restaurant is to be seen again.
Frank has his arm around Tony, introducing him to a business-type. Elvira looks on.

88 INT. HIGH-FASHION STORE - DAY 88
In a high-fashion store, Tony buys a beautiful dress for Gina who is delighted when she sees herself in the mirror, hugs Tony. Manny watches, unable to take his eyes off her.

SALESLADY
(admiringly to Tony)
Your wife looks terrific in that.

TONY
My wife? You gotta be kidding.

89 INT. LOBBY - LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 89
Elvira steps out in a Pucci summer dress, looks around. Tony is waiting for her. She's surprised.

TONY
He got held up at the golf club. He told me to pick you up. He`ll meet us at the race track.

Elvira contemplating him with distaste.

TONY
He said if he was late to get Ice Cream first.

She sighs, walks across the lobby. He follows.

90 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 90

Elvira steps out of the lobby into the driveway.  He points.

TONY
Over there....

She looks. The car is a yellow Cadillac convertible with 2
big fins and Snoopy the dwarf dashboard statue with stickers
all over the fenders. Adding to the impression are Manny
and Chi-Chi waiting in the backseat.

ELVIRA
(registers it with distaste)
That thing? You must be kidding.

TONY
(hurt)
Whaddaya mean, that's a Cadillac.

ELVIRA
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.

TONY
It's got a few years on it but it's 'a creampuff.'

ELVIRA
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

91 INT. LUXURY MOTOR SALES - CORAL GABLES - DAY 91
Camera moves around a slick, red Jaguar -- XG 6 -- with Tony, accompanied by Manny, Chi-Chi, the Salesman. Elvira waits aloofly off to the side.

TONY
(to Elvira)
So you like this better?

ELVIRA
(shrugs)
It's got style.

TONY
Yeah it looks like one of the tigers from India.

MANNY
(to Elvira)
Tony been dragging me around to the zoos, looking at tigers. He wants to buy one of them too.
(amused)
He do that he gonna have no friends left. Not that he got any now.

TONY
You'll like the tiger Manny, you'll see.

ELVIRA
You going to drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat Tony?

TONY
Yeah... maybe some lady tiger.
(to Salesman)
How much?

SALESMAN
Twenty-eight thousand dollars. Fully equipped.

TONY
(genuinely)
That all?

SALESMAN
Machine gun turrets are extra.

TONY
(circling the car)
Funny guy hunh... Manny, c'mere.

Manny comes over and Tony walks him along the car, in
quieter tones.

TONY
Get these sections bullet-proofed... here... here... these windows...

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
...and a phone with a scrambler.

MANNY
Okay...

TONY
...And one of those radio scanners, y'know, pick out flying saucers and stuff.

MANNY
Yeah, a good one.

ELVIRA
(joining them)
Don't forget the fog lights.

TONY
Yeah, in case I go to the swamps, good idea.

ELVIRA
(impatiently)
I thought you were taking me to Frank?

TONY
(glances at his watch)
We still got an hour. You hungry?

ELVIRA
No, but I'm bored.

TONY
Figgers. Check it out, will you Manny and pay the guy and grab a
taxi out to the track....

Thanks, yeah....

TONY
(before leaving)
Oh yeah.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private joke. He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, ""Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag.""

Elvira wonders about it as he joins her.

TONY
Somebody gotta keep the animals out.

92 EXT. LUXURY MOTORS - DAY 92
Tony leads her to his yellow Cadillac convertible parked out of eyesight of the others.

TONY
I'm glad you came. I wouldn't buy the car you didn't like it.

ELVIRA
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you?

TONY
Yeah -- you know who.
They get in the car.

ELVIRA
And what would Frank say?

She has a coke vial out, casually hits one nostril, then
other, then takes a last hit through the mouth.

TONY
I like Frank.. -but I like you better.

He reaches over and takes the coke from her. Does a toot,
staring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,
makes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He
kisses her. She goes with it.

Pause. She pulls back.

ELVIRA
(same tone of voice as before)
Don't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.

As he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.

CUT TO
INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93
Subtitle appears:

COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.

Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey"" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.

SOSA
So this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady
market. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...

Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose.
Pause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.

SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.

OMAR
That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.

SOSA
Yes, it would've been nice if he could have come.

TONY
(cutting in)
and he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?

SOSA
(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)
So he sent you?

TONY
Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.

Looking over the laboratory like it was his.
Omar glances at him, annoyed.

SOSA
We'll talk at my house. Shall we go...

CUT TO
94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94
The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

SOSA
(to Omar)
...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.

OMAR
Well, we do that, we gotta take the
risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You
know what that means?

TONY
That means we gotta go to war with
`em.
looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make
Sosa
of this guy.
SOSA
When we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.

TONY
Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.

SOSA
Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.

TONY
13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You
know what that's like these days?
They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.

Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

SOSA
What do you suggest is a fair...?
Excuse me.

Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves
him in.

The black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.

Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
A beat.
He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

OMAR
(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)
Shaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!

Tony shrugs.

SOSA
Where were we?

TONY
Panama. You're looking for a partner, right?

Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.

SOSA
...something like that.
(chuckles)

OMAR
Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...

TONY
Hey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.

OMAR
Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!

TONY
(shrugs)
Frank'll love it. Don't worry about it.

OMAR
That's up to Frank -- not you.

He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing
-- also an advantage in the split.

OMAR
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...

SOSA
It's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to
Frank.

OMAR
(a beat)
Okay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.

SOSA
(without hesitation)
Good. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.
You can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.

Omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.

OMAR
Yeah. I guess so....

TONY
Great.

SOSA
(glancing at Tony, to Omar)
...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.

OMAR
(doesn't get it)
I don't think that...

TONY
(lighting a cigar)
Hey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...

Sosa laughs. Omar scowls.

CUT TO

95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95

The helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:
Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.

The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
polo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a
horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.

Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

TONY
You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?

SOSA
Why?

TONY
Cause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.

Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.

TONY
(overlapping the joke)
They got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.

SOSA
Maybe he'll move to Miami too...
Gabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?

Sosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.

GABRIELLA
(distracted)
Lovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.

SOSA
I'll take care of it myself.

GABRIELLA
(turning to him)
...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.

SOSA
Of course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...
(to Tony)
My fiance, Gabriella Montini.

TONY
Hello....
She nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.

GABRIELLA
It's a pleasure.

She withdraws. Tony watches her go.

TONY
I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.

Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.

SOSA
(focusing the binoculars)
I like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel
the same way about the rest of your organization.

Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.

TONY
In-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?

SOSA
I mean Omar Suarez.

Tony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.

Sosa passes him the binoculars.

SOSA
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.
From several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....

Tony, astonished, looks up.

96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96
terrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by
the Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a
length of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.

SOSA
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.

Through the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the
chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.
A silence.


97 TONY 97
shaken, lowers the binoculars.
Sosa watches him closely for his reaction.
Tony looks back at him, contemplative.
Sosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.

SOSA
So how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?

TONY
(awry, stalks up to him)
Hey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.
That piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..
For all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!

SOSA
(moves away)
I think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this
Lopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.

TONY
Hey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.
(then)
You got my word on that.

Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,
makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony
following the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.

SOSA
You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.

Their eyes locked together.

In all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach
and rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.
Music theme continuing over.

REVERSE WIPE TO

99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99
In long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny
outside his office.
He jerks his head. Inside. They go.

CUT TO
100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100
The office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,
Cuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on
JFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares
incredulously at Tony.

LOPEZ
(livid)
You what! You made a deal for fucking eighteen million dollars
without even checking with me! What are you crazy Montana, are you crazy!

TONY
Hey take it easy Frank, cone.

LOPEZ
Con0 my ass!

TONY
At 10.5 a key, it's pure Frank... we can`t lose money, no way, we make seventy-five million on this deal, Frank. Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.

LOPEZ
Yeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.

TONY
Frank... Frank...

LOPEZ
(ranting)
You know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?
...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.
Cause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?
(pause, eyeing Tony)
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?

TONY
You saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?

Lopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.

LOPEZ
(carefully)
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall
your deal with Sosa.

Long pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.

TONY
(finally)
...have it your way boss.

He turns to leave, nods to Manny.

LOPEZ
Montana... just remember I am the boss.

TONY
Sure you're the boss.

Gets to the door, Manny joining him.

LOPEZ
Y'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.

Tony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.

101 EXT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE 101
Just outside the door, Tony glances at Manny's question-mark
expression.

TONY
(with steel)
Fuck him!

101 - EXT. SHEFFIELD'S OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - 101



102 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 102
Tony, impeccable in Cardin whites, and Manny, also slicked
up, are shown by an elegant secretary into a plush office.
Behind the desk sits the heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed lawyer,

George Sheffield smoking yet another cigarette, his voice a
hoarse gravelled croak, the eyes -- with their deadpan stare
-- always pausing before they speak. He doesn't get up from
his desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the
Mutiny Club.

SHEFFIELD
What can I do for you Montana?

TONY
(indicates Manny)
My partner. Manny Ray.

Manny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes
briefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.

TONY
So George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.

SHEFFIELD
Did they also tell you how expensive I am?

TONY
Hey it's like J.P. Morgan says -- if you gotta ask, you're outta your league.

SHEFFIELD
I see you been reading your American history Montana, what've you done lately to earn a place in it?

TONY
(chuckles)
I'm trying to stay outta it, y'know
what I mean? I'm expanding my operation. So I want a class guy like you on the payroll -- advising me. Starting now.

SHEFFIELD
(a longer pause than usual)
Cash. On the table.
...Start with a $100,000.

TONY
(an equal pause)
Sure...

He sticks out his hand. Manny slaps an envelope in it. Tony
begins counting out the cash, right on the tabletop.

CUT TO

103 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - DAY 103
Tony waits in his red Jaguar in the driveway of the building.
Lopez and his bodyguard exit the building.
A limousine pulls up.
Tony watches.
The threesome get in the limo and drive away.
Tony gets out of the car, crosses to the entrance.

104 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 104
Tony waits outside the door, pushes the buzzer again.
Elvira opens it, a look of utter surprise on her face. She`s
in jeans, barefoot and casual.

ELVIRA
Tony?

TONY
Hi there.

Elvira looks at him, still astonished and waiting for an
explanation. There is none.

ELVIRA.
ml.. -you just missed Frank.

TONY
I didn't come here to see Frank.
She looks at him amazed. The balls on this guy!

ELVIRA
(cooling to him fast)
This is not the time or the place.
Next time make an appointment first.

She tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and
bulls in.

TONY
I got something important to tell ya.
Why don't you make some drinks and act normal.

ELVIRA
Sure. Why not? We're all normal here.

She heads for the pool, nonplussed. Tony closes the door, eases slowly across the room towards her, awkwardly trying to make conversation.

TONY
I heard you was in Europe travelling 'round all by yourself. Woman like you shouldn't have to travel alone...
(pause, no response)
I been travelling myself.

ELVIRA
Broadening your intellect. I heard.

TONY
What else d'you hear?

ELVIRA
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.

TONY
Yeah. It makes things easier this way, don't it?

She's puzzled. He drinks a toast.

TONY
Here's to the land of opportunity.

ELVIRA
For you maybe.

She drinks to it.

TONY
Hey, do you like kids?

ELVIRA
Kids? Sure, why not -- as long as there's a nurse.

TONY
Good. Cause I like kids too. I like boys and girls.

She's waiting. He paws the ground, awkward as a bull.

ELVIRA
That's broad of you, Tony. Travelling really helped. Look, Frank's going to be back any moment and when he walks through that....

TONY
Yeah. Yeah -- fuck Frank. Look, here's the story. I'm from the gutter but I climbed out of it. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I got guts and I know the streets and I'm making the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go to the top, I could be somebody here in Miami. I could  be like Frank but bigger -- The biggest!

Elvira's looking at him like he's on the moon.

TONY
Anyway what I came up here to tell you is that.. .uh I like you. I think you're terrific. I known this the first time I seen you. You belong to me. We're tigers. The two of us... I want you to marry me and be the mother of my children.

Silence.

ELVIRA
(stunned)
Me? Marry you?

She laughs, a short harsh laugh.

TONY
(sincere)
Yeah... -marry me.

ELVIRA
What about Frank? What are you going to do about Frank?

TONY
Frank's not gonna last...
(puts down the drink, puts his hand on hers)
I'm not looking for an answer right now Elvira, but I want you to think about it, okay? I want you to think hard... I'll see you the next time.

He goes. She stares at him, still dazed, yet deep down -- flattered.

CUT TO

105 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105

The place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in
tuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the
many people who know them now. We might note Tony has
refined the art of walking and no longer bulls people out
of his path, he angles through them.

OWNER
(indicating a table)
Over here.

Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.

TONY
What the fuck is she doing here, she's....
(heading towards her)

MANNY
(stops him)
Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's justa disco for chrissake. What do you give her money for if you don't want her to go out, have some fun?

Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves back. Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.

TONY
Who's she with?

MANNY
Some kid, he works for Luco, he's harmless....

Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him. Caucasian,
about 250 pounds.

TONY
Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
don't dance too close.

MANNY
Sure Tony.
(drifting away)
I'll be at the table.

LARGE MAN
(intersecting)
Hello Tony, you remember me?


TONY
(to the Large Man)
Yeah, sure. You're...
(snaps fingers trying to remember)
...Bernstein, right. Mel Bernstein.
Narcotics, right?

BERNSTEIN
That's right, Tony.
I think we better talk.
(indicates a quieter area)

There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's cause just the eyes do the smiling.

TONY
Talk about what, what's there to talk about? I ain't killed anybody
lately.

BERNSTEIN
No not lately but we can go back to ancient history.
Like Emilio Rebenga, like a bunch of whacked Indians at
the Sun-Ray Motel in Miami Beach....

TONY
Oh yeah? ...you know Mel, whoever's giving you your information must be taking you guys for a long ride.

BERNSTEIN
Are we gonna talk or am I gonna bust your wiseass spic balls, Tony baby -- here and now?

Tony looks at him.

CUT TO
106 INT. BABYLON CLUB - CORNER TABLE - TONY AND MEL 106
in a corner of the Babylon -- talking.

BERNSTEIN
Yeah, so the news on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo
Tony... that you're no longer a small-time hood, you're public property now, and the Supreme Court says your privacy can be invaded....

TONY
No shit -- how much?

BERNSTEIN
(doodling on a piece of paper)
There's an answer to that too....

He holds the paper up briefly in front of Tony. It says ""25,000""

TONY
(reacts)
That's a big number.

BERNSTEIN
That's on a monthly basis. Every month the same thing. You know how this works, don't you? We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me. When we hit, it hurts -- Same thing works the other way. You feed me a bust now and then, some new cowboy wants to go into business you let us know -- we like snacks, it looks good on the record.

TONY
S'pose I give you the money, how do I know you're the last bull I gotta grease? What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?

BERNSTEIN
That's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.
(getting up)
I don't want this discussion going any farther than this table. MY WYS have families, they're legitimate cops, I don't want none of `em getting' embarrassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer. Comprendre?
...Oh yeah, and I got a vacation comin' up. I wanna take the wife to
London, England. We never been there. Throw in two round-trip tickets. First class.

Tony just stares at him. Bernstein smiles, points.

BERNSTEIN
I like the scar. Nice. Like Capone.
But you oughta smile more, Tony. Enjoy yourself.
Everyday aboveground's a good day.

He winks and goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back to the dance floor.

Burgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance floor. Too close.
Tony is getting pissed, he looks around for Manny, then spots....

107 INT. BABYLON CLUB ENTWWCE - NIGHT 107
Elvira walking into the club, followed by Lopez and Ernie,
the bodyguard. Lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy,
the Owner, and Elvira drifts in.
His attention diverted from Gina, Tony goes towards her.
She sees him coming, glances in Frank's direction.
Tony comes right up to her.

TONY
Hi...

ELVIRA
Hello, Tony.

Lopez, in conversation with the Owner, glances over, sees
Tony with Elvira, his expression narrows.

TONY
so.. .Did you think about.what I said? About the kids?

ELVIRA
Tony, you're really nuts you know, -- you really are.

Lopez comes over, takes Elvira's arm, and smiles at Tony.

LOPEZ
Hey Tony, why don't you get your own girl?

TONY
That's what I'm doing, Frank.

Tense look on Frank's face. The bodyguard circles.

LOPEZ
(without a smile)
Then go do it somewhere else. Get
lost.

ELVIRA
Frank, he was only...

TONY
(ignoring her)
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes,
man.

LOPEZ
You won't be hearing anything, you
go on like this.

TONY
You gonna stop me?

Frank is livid.

LOPEZ
You're fucking right I am. I'm giving you orders.
Blow. (Esfumate)

The bodyguard moves closer to Tony who doesn't move.

Manny suddenly slides into frame, backing Tony.

TONY
(icy)
Orders? There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron -- balls.

Pause. Something's about to pop, turns back just at the
crest. Lopez abruptly turns away.

LOPEZ
(to Elvira)
Let's go!

ELVIRA
Frank, this is ridiculous....

LOPEZ
C'mon!

He crowds her. she goes. Angry, Tony watches as they exit the club.

MANNY
What happened?

TONY
That cocksucker! -- He put that homicide prick Bernstein on me.

They stroll back to the table.

MANNY
What for?

TONY
The Emilio Rebenga hit. Remember that.

MANNY
You're kidding!

TONY
Who else knew about it? Omar's fertilizer, ain't he? Lopez is letting me know he's got weight on me.

MANNY
I don't know, things don't look so good here, Tony. Maybe we should get outta town for a while, y'know, go up to New York?

TONY
You go. I like the weather here just fine.

He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she
follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the
stairs to the toilets.
Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts
after her.

MANNY
Hey, where you going?

He doesn't answer.

CUT TO
108 INT. BABYLON CLUB - STAIRS AND LADIES ROOM - NIGHT 10E
Tony comes down the plush velvet stairs, flings himself
into the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at
him. No Gina.

109 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MEN'S ROOM AND STAIRS - NIGHT 109
He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.
Tony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
the door. It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
burgundy suit running his hand along her ass.

GINA
(shocked)
Tony!

TONY
What are you doing! What are you doing!

He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
times into the wall.

GINA
(trying to restrain him)
Tony! What're you doing! You're crazy!

He rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles.

TONY
(to Gina)
What are you doing with this shit, hunh?
(back to burgundy suit)
Get the fuck out of here, maricon, y'hear, I'll kill you next time.

GINA
Fernando!

TONY
(to Gina)
Shaddup!

Manny runs in, several others now looking in from the hall.

MANNY
Tony!

Tony shoves burgundy suit out of the stall, past Manny.

TONY
Go on!

GINA
What the hell is....

TONY
You think it's cute somebody puttin' their hands all over your ass, my kid sister, hunh? In a toilet!

GINA
It's none of your business!

TONY
The fuck it isn't! Three dollar hooker, that's what you are.
Snorting shit like that at your age, you oughta ---

GINA
What are you -- a priest? A cop! Look at your life. You can't tell
me what to do!

TONY
I'm telling ya! I don't wanna see you in here again. I catch you in here I'm gonna beat the shit outta you.

GINA
Oh yeah! Go ahead!

TONY
You're getting outta here right now!
Don't push me baby, don't push me!

GINA
Don't fucking push me!

MANNY
Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get some air...

The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
the hallway. Several more people are watching.

GINA
You got a nerve, Tony, you got a nerve! You can't tell me what to do. I'll do what I want to do. I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!

Tony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.
Tony stands there, abated.

The crowd is silent.

Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.

MANNY
(tender)
Come on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.
(strokes her face)

TONY
(disturbed, to Manny)
Get her home, get her outta here!

He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
no regrets, but disturbed.

Manny helps Gina to her feet.

MANNY
Come on, pussycat, I'll buy you a
cup of coffee.

CUT TO
110 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 110
Tony, isolated and edgy, reenters the main room, circling
the edges of the crowd, up to the bar.

TONY
(to the bartenderess, pointing)
Gimme a double of that!

He turns, catches a last glimpse of Gina leaving with Manny.

CUT TO
111 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 111
Manny drives Gina home in his two-seater Mercedes sports
coupe. She's still angry.

GINA
...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
Mama's right. She says he hurts everything he touches.
Well he's not gonna hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
again. Never!

MANNY
He loves you, what do you want. He
feels he raised you.

GINA
He still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been in jail five years and he still thinks I'm fifteen!

MANNY
Hey, you're the best thing he's got. The only thing. He don't want you to grow up to be like him. So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...

GINA
Against what?

MANNY
'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.

He says it like it's personal.

GINA
(picks up on it)
I like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.

MANNY
(a face)
What future's he got? On a bandstand somewhere? He's a bum, Why don't you go out with somebody who's
going somewhere?

She gives him a look.

GINA
Like who?

MANNY
Like a doctor or a dentist or something.

GINA
What about you? Why don't you take me out?

She's looking straight at him now, challenging.

MANNY
What? Me?

GINA
Yeah, you. I see the way you look at me -- Manolo Ribera.

MANNY
(nervous)
Hey, Tony's like my brother.. You're his kid sister, okay?

GINA
So what?

MANNY
So....

GINA
(taunting)
You afraid of Tony? You afraid of Tony's kid sister?

MANNY
Fuck no....

112 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 112
Pulls the car over to the curb.

MANNY
I guess we're here.

Pause.

GINA
You think about it, okay, you think about it real hard, Manny. Cause you don't know what you're missing....

She leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.

She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.

CUT BACK TO
113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113
The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's ""Strangers In The Night'.

OWNER
All right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?
Now I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.

He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.

Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
When the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.

Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...

...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close, a haunting figure of mockery....

Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....

The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors...
Screams, crowd diving for cover...

Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of
his ankle, firing...
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...

Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.

Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.

The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.

CUT TO
114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114
Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.

Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.

The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.

Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.

Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.

Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows.
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
the armor plating, whining against the shutters.

Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

CUT TO

115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115
Tony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
reveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
it, doesn't express a reaction.

DOCTOR
It's going to be sore for a few months.

TONY
Somebody else gonna be a lot sorer...
(to Chi-Chi)
Find out where Lopez is....

CUT TO
116 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 116
Miriam's a tough-looking little chick in panties and a tanktop with ""Cocaine"" written on it.

TONY'S VOICE
Miriam? Yeah...Tony. Manny there?

MIRIAM
Yeah... It's Tony.

Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror, takes the phone, in good spirits.

MANNY
Tony cabrone, whatcha doing -- checking up on me, too?

117 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT INT. 117

TONY
Look, get your fuckin' clothes on and meet me outside Lopez's office in forty-five minutes. That phonebooth on 9th. Yeah.
Move your ass!

118 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 118

MANNY
What happened!

119 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 119
TONY (v.o.)
Nothing we can't fix.

Tony hangs up.

120 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 120

MANNY
(grabs his pants)
I gotta go.

MIRIAM
This is worse than fucking a grasshopper, man.

MANNY
Hey, I'm better looking.
(hits the coke again)
Don't do it all, I'll be back later.

CUT TO
121 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:
Tony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.

TONY
(to Nick)
Nick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly. You got that?

NICK
Yeah, don't worry Tony. I got it.

TONY
All you say is you're one of the guys at the-club -- 'Hello, Mr. Lopez, there was a fuckup, he got away...'

NICK
Yeah, Tony, I got it, no problem...

CUT TO
122 INT. LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122
Waldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny
and Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...
Lopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.

LOPEZ'S VOICE
...you're kidding! Three to two?
Son of a bitch!...
(cradling the phone)
Guess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!

MUFFLED VOICE
Congratulations. That's great Frank.

Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
with guns casually drawn.

123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123

TONY
Yeah, it sure is Frank. What'd you do -- fix the umpire?

Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
there and then, but manages to recover.

LOPEZ
Tony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.

Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
other side of the room.

LOPEZ
Tony... what happened to you, hunh?

TONY
Yeah, lookit. They spoiled one of
my $800 suits.

LOPEZ
Jesus! Who?

in his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.

TONY
Hitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.
Never seen 'em before...Hiya
ii:;. Is there an answer to this too?

BERNSTEIN
(uneasy)
Always is Montana, always is...

LOPEZ
Jesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.

TONY
Hey, you might be right.

LOPEZ
Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.

TONY
(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)
Nah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.

Pause.

LOPEZ
(awkward)
Well... What are the guns for Tony?

TONY
(shrugs)
What for? I'm paranoid I guess.

The phone rings.
Lopez lets the phone ring.

TONY
Why don't you answer it Frank?

LOPEZ
Must be Elvira. You know women.
After we left that joint she....

The phone rings again.

TONY
(reaches for it)
I'll tell her you're not here.

LOPEZ
(grabs the phone first)
Wait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...
(anxious)
Yeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.

He hangs up. Pause.

TONY
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

LOPEZ
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony?

Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

TONY
You know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!

LOPEZ
Tony, no! Lissen!

TONY
You remember what a 'haza' is Frank?
It's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.

LOPEZ
(nervous)
Why would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !

TONY
Yeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the
side but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!

He squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.

LOPEZ
Mel! Mel! Do something, please!

Mel sits there impassively.

MEL
It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.

LOPEZ
Please Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million. I'll
give you ten million dollars right now ! I got it in a vault. In Spain. We'll get on a plane. It's yours, all of it... Elvira? You want Elvira? She's yours, okay! I'll go away Tony, I disappear, you'll never
see me again. Just gimme a chance, gimme a second chance Tony, please... please!

He sobs pathetically.

LOPEZ
I don't wanna die Tony, I never did nothing to nobody Tony! I never hurt nobody!

TONY
Yeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.

He turns to Manny.

TONY
Manny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?

Tony steps aside.

LOPEZ
No! No! Tony!

Manny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.
Lopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in
his bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.

TONY
...Every dog has his day.

He fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN
(remaining calmly in his chair)
I told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.

TONY
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.

His eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.

BERNSTEIN
Now wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.

TONY
I'm not Mel. You are.

He produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his
left hand pointed at the big man.

BERNSTEIN
(rising from his chair)
Hey, c'mon, what is this?
You can't shoot a cop, Tony.

TONY
Whoever said you were one?

He fires.

Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.

BERNSTEIN
I... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...

TONY
Sure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.

He fires several times into him until we can imagine he is
no longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.

MANNY
(indicates bodyguard)
What about him?

Tony notices.
The bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.

TONY
You want a job Ernie?

ERNIE
Sure, Tony.

TONY
Come see me tomorrow.

ERNIE
Thanks, Tony.

Tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the
hulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny
and Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.

MANNY
(Offscreen)
Okay, torch it!

Tony, still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling, moves past her into the apartment.

ELVIRA
What's happened?

Tony just stands there.

ELVIRA
Where's Frank?

TONY
Where do you think? ...Why don't you go pack your stuff. We're going home.

Pause. She understands, moves quietly past him towards the
bedroom.

Tony ambles over to the windows and steps out on the terrace,
breathing in the air. The lights of Miami wink at his feet...

which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
sign on the front lawn that says:
THE WORLD IS YOURS

MONTANA TRAVEL CO.

Just like it should be.

. . . as Tony and Elvira take their marriage vows in front of
the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely short dress, looping earrings, the camera moving to Gina, her eyes covertly tracking to Manny who gazes back at her, evenly and openly as....
Tony and Elvira kiss.

Tony, eating his wedding cake, his arm around Elvira, nuzzling her, shows his entourage his new hobby.

CUT TO
151-B INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - MONTH DATER 151-B

Tony, accompanied by Manny, walks a young, thirtyish bank
president into his office, which is rigged with video monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.

There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs -- but not one sign of a book on the walls.

Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who never stops thinking money.

TONY
...yeah, well, I can't pay that no more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in more'n I ever brung in, y'know. I'm talking ten million a month now. That's serious money. So I think it's time you bank boys come down a bit, y'know, like....

BANKER
Hey, Tony, c'mon, that's crazy, I can't do...

TONY
That's too bad, cause....

BANKER
Tony, sweetheart, we're not a wholesale operation here, we're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give us the harder it is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we can't even take anymore of your money unless we raise the rates on you.

TONY
You gonna what, Jerry?

BANKER
Tony, Tony, we gotta. The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any. We gotta do it Tony, we got stockholders, we gotta go ten percent on the first twelve million; that's in denominations of twenty. We'll go eight percent on your ten dollar bills and six points on your fives.

TONY
Ten points!

we go someplace else.
Hey, Tony,

BANKER
Tony, Tony -- it's no conspiracy, we're all doing it. You're not gonna find a better deal.

TONY
Then fuck you, I'll fly the cash to the Bahamas myself.

BANKER
You gonna fly it yourself, Tony -- on a regular basis? Once maybe. And then what? You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank with twenty million of your hard-earned dollars? C'mon Tony, don't be a schmuck -- who else can you trust? That's why you pay us what you do -- you trust us.

Tony looks broodingly. Jerry glances at his watch, suggesting
he has another engagement,

BANKER
Stay with us, you're an old and well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us... gentlemen, I gotta run. How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.
See you. Take care.

Going.

Tony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:

TONY
That prick, that WASP whore. Jhat's
come over he think I am, some maricon on a boat....

So why don't we talk to this Jew Seidelbaum? He's got his own exchange, he charges four percent tops -- and he's connected.

TONY
I don't know. Mob guys -- guineas -- I don't trust 'em.

On the video monitor, Tony watches Jerry, the Banker, leaving. Now beginning to see things through the glass darkly, Tony hits the other nostril quickly, casually -- passing the vial to Manny who does his hit.

TONY
(eyes wandering across to another video monitor)
You get the house sweeped this month? The cars?

MANNY
Yeah, sure, I told you that. Five thousand it set us back.

TONY
See that cable truck there?

152 INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - VIDEO MONITORS 152
Tony's eyes fixing on the cable TV truck parked across the
street.
A man is hauling cable.
There are other private gates visible. The area is lush with gardens, Spanish moss, cypresses and quietly respectable million dollar houses with their Spanish tile roofs and balconies.

MANNY
Yeah?

TONY
Hey Manny when does it take three
days to rig a cable, hunh?

MANNY
Cops.

TONY
What if it's the Diaz brothers? What if they're gonna come and get me?

MANNY
I'll check it out.

TONY
You check it out, then we're gonna blow that fuckin' truck back to Bogota.

MANNY
The truck could be anything. We're not the only dopers living on the block y'know.

TONY
Hey you got some attitude y'know Manny -- for a guy in charge of my security.

Hey I'll check it out. I'm just telling you we're spending too much
on this counter-surveillance shit. Twelve percent y'know, of our adjusted gross -- that's not pocket money.

TONY
You worry about it, it lets me sleep
good at night. There's that fat guy
again.

Manny looks over at a jogger running by the gate -- of the
porcine quality, civilian-looking, fifties.

TONY
I seen him every day. 'Bout a week now.

MANNY
So the guy jogs around the neighborhood. He's some fat accountant.

TONY
How the fuck do you know what he is?

MANNY
Hey if he's a cop, don't you think running in circles around a house is a pretty dumb way to watch it?

TONY
Maybe not...
(walks away, stops, looks back)
I'm telling you we're getting sloppy -- our thinking -- our attitude.
We're not fucking hungry anymore!

A television spot for Florida Security Trust (or Miami Security Trust or Dade Security Trust depending on legal options). A respectable business-type walks along the sidewalk with a renascent downtown Miami as a backdrop. Skyscrapers, glinting glass, cranes....

better America. We've been around for seventy-five years. We'll be here tomorrow.

A logo for the firm over with the reminder ""Since 1907.""

Camera pulling back to reveal Tony watching in his huge gold-
leaf bathtub, a cigar clenched between his teeth. He looks
like a character in a Futzie Nutzie loafing cartoon, with his
TV hooked to one side of the tub, a long phone line to the
other, and a radio and portable bar all within reach.

TONY
(to the TV)
Yeah that's cause for seventy-five years you been fucking all of us over, that's why.
(to Manny)
Somebody oughta do something about these whores. Charging me ten points on my money and they're getting away with it! There's no laws anymore,anything goes.
Listen, these guys been here for a thousand years. They got all the angles figured.

Manny straddles a chair next to the tub watching the m
news that was interrupted by the Florida Security Trust
commerical. Behind him Elvira's in d robe, fixing herself
up in front of a giant mirror. It's some bathroom --
gigantic with a chandelier hanging in the middle of it,
Italian marble, plants, skylights, rugs, etc....

TONY
You know what capitalism is --
Getting fucked.

ELVIRA
A true capitalist if ever I met one.

She's doing a toot of coke off a flat mirror.

TONY
How would you know, bubblehead? You ever do nothing 'sides get your hair fixed and powder your nose? You do too much of that shit anyway.

ELVIRA
Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that Tony.

TONY
Know what? Why do you always got to talk like that?

MANNY
(changing the subject)
So I had a pow-wow with this guy
Seidelbaum today. He checks out.
I  got another meet set up.

TONY
When?

MANNY
Thursday ten o'clock. I thought I'd take Chi-Chi with me. Do a million and some change. Get my- feet wet with this guy.

TONY
That's a lot of wet. I'm not Rockefeller. Not yet.

Tony points to a figure on the TV.

TONY
Hey, listen to this, guy's always good for a laugh.

Visual of silver-haired television Anchorman -- Vic Phillips -- with a bit of show business image in him -- to be seen again. Underneath his face, it says ""Editorial.""

NEWS ANCHORMAN
...the question is how with a small law enforcement budget do you put a dent in an estimated $100 billion a year business? It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray but now we are hearing voices that say the only way we can solve the drug problem is the same way Prohibition was solved.
Not by outlawing the substances but by legalizing and taxing them. These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element...
(pause for effect)
I am not one of those voices.

TONY
(responding)
What do you know -- you never been right in your life, Vic baby...

TONY
What's boring?

ELVIRA
You're boring. Money, money, money!
That's all I hear in this house. Frank never talked about money.

TONY
Cause Frank was dumb.

ELVIRA
You know what you've become Tony -- an arriviste, an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking about how much money he's got or how he's getting fucked. Why don't you just dig a hole in the garden honey and bury it and forget it.

TONY

DISSOLVE TO

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY
Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
""CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.

160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 160
The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
moving, talking.
Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.

The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
look the part.

It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.
At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.

LUIS
. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
I was in that picture down in Columbia.
Burn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.
We're good friends. I was his driver...

NICK
(stacking)
Oh yeah?

LUIS
Yeah, in Caragena, they shot it there... Gillo Pontecorvo, he was the director. Italian guy.
(pause)
Yeah, I also know Paul Newman. I worked with him in Tucson.

NICK THE PIG

Alvarez there?

Seven checks. A million three hundred twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three ...plus eighteen cents.

Eyes darting. Considering the options. The little fat man's eyes are suddenly agile and mean-.-Tony reads them, lifts his arms.

Get it.

Luis moves around Tony to disarm him.

Hey, Tony, what's three years? lt's not like Cuba here. It's like going to a hotel.

Tony shakes his head, grimacing like he's having an
epileptic fit.

SHEFFIELD
I'll delay the trial. A year and a half, two years, you won't start doing time till '85.

TONY
No...no, they never get me back in a cage.. -never! HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?

SHEFFIELD
Tony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.

Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
Sheffield's desk.

TONY
All right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell
you about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.' If you're rain-making the judge or you fuck me for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap -- you, the judge, the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop me, y'hear?
I'm gonna come and tear your fuckin' eyeballs out.

Pause.

SHEFFIELD
(cool)
The point is made. Now where's the money?

Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
desk. Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
hands as he steps out of the office. He sniffs.

167 EXT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 167
Camera follows Tony with Ernie and Chi-Chi dowr'the outside
gallery onto the veranda where Sosa is reclining with
several other men -- all in casual clothes, enjoying their
coffee after lunch.

SOSA
(rising)
Tony...Tony.

TONY
Alex.

They hug like they were the closest of friends.

SOSA
I'm glad you made it on such short notice. I appreciate it. How`s Elvira?

TONY
She's okay. How's your wife?

SOSA
Three more months.

TONY
That's great.

SOSA
And you, when are you going to have another Tony to take your place.

TONY
(sore point)
I'm working on it.

SOSA
I guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.

They laugh, nervously. Sosa is a little more reserved with
him than before -- in tune.with the other men at the meeting.

SOSA
Tony, come, I want you to meet some friends of mine.

He smoothly guides Tony towards the group of men who rise.

SOSA
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of Andes Sugar here...Tony Montana.

PEDRO QUINN
A pleasure, Mr. Montana.

Camera tracking through ad-lib introductions, the music
assuming a faint martial stride.

SOSA
General Eduardo Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps...Tony Montana.

The man is in civilian clothes.

SOSA
Ariel Bleyer, from the Ministry of the Interior... Tony Montana.

The cameras moving past Sosa's black aide, the Skull (who
nailed Omar) silent behind his sunglasses, to an American-
type in a Brooks Brothers suit who stands.

SOSA
Charles Goodson -- a friend of ours from Washington.

TONY
Hi....

GOODSON
How do you do, Mr. Montana...

He smells like a government guy. Sosa summons the black aide -- in a hushed voice.

SOSA
Nicky, have Albert meet us in the living room.

The black aide goes.

SOSA
(solicitous)
Tony, come, please sit here.

Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
surrounded on all sides. There is a strained beat to the
proceedings. Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.

He suddenly catches a glimpse of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
moving with another woman past a window of the house. Then
she's gone.

Sosa pulls up a chair right opposite Tony, almost touching
knees.

SOSA
Tony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here....

TONY
Sure, Alex.

SOSA
Tony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems.

Tony waits.

SOSA
We all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....

Pause. Tony looks. The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
gaze away.

TONY
And your problem, Alex?

Sosa looks around, stands up.

SOSA
Come, I'll show you.

Tony cautiously stands to follow him.

CUT TO
168 INSERT - INT. SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168
MATOS STUDY
A ""Phil Donahue-type"" setting. A segment now in progress
with the ""Donahue-type"" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.
Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and
polished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of
enormous passion.

GUTIERREZ
More than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It
sells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!

INTERVIEWER
I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.

GUTIERREZ
The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,
Jim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.

INTERVIEWER
So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

GUTIERREZ
(laughs)
Let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --

Gutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV
screen, dour, ruthless.

GUTIERREZ
. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?

Laughter.

169 TONY 169
watching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from
the coke usage.

SOSA
A Communist -- financed by Moscow.

170 GUTIERREZ 170
holds up another photograph -- insert the face on the
TV screen.

GUTIERREZ
...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....

INTERVIEWER
What are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?

GUTIERREZ
(passionate)
The United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.

171 TONY 171
staring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.

GUTIERREZ
You Americans have no idea how important your country is as a
symbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....

Sosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.

SOSA
...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...
That's our problem.

TONY
Yeah.

Sosa looks up.

The Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into
the room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over
Tony. The Skull leads him in.

SOSA
You've met Alberto before?...

TONY
(remains seated)
Sure. How could I forget?

SOSA
Alberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.

Alberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.

SOSA
(to Tony)
So you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...
(*en)
Is that a problem, Tony?

Tony looks around the faces, then:

TONY
That's no problem, Alex....

Alex nods, pleased.
Hold on Tony. He blows his nose again.

CUT TO

175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT
A millionaire's place, like ""The Forge"" on Arthur Godfrey
Road. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.

TONY
Hey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.

Vic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--
cranes his leonine white head of hair around with a
patrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.

VIC
Oh, is that so?

TONY
Yeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?

VIC
Aren't you... Tony Montana?

TONY
(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)
Yeah, that's me.

The half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.

TONY
(waves to them)
Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.

Waves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.

MANNY
(reproving)
Hey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....

TONY
I don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!

Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip
of an anguish he does not understand.

CUT TO

173 TONY
sits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....

MANNY
So what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?

TONY
Lot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.
The whole world's turning into politics.

He pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.

MANNY
The one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.

TONY
Yeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?

Manny remembers.

TONY
No free rides in this world, kid.

MANNY
So who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?

ELVIRA
What guy?

TONY
(to Manny)
You stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.

He takes a hit, unnoticed.

ELVIRA
(unheard)
What guy?

MANNY
(to Tony)
I don't like it.

TONY
You don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!

What's Seidelbaum got to do with this?
Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
Elvira's untouched plate.

TONY
Why don't you eat your food, what's
wrong with it?

ELVIRA
I'm not hungry.

She quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-
ment of her hand.

TONY
So what'd you order it for?

ELVIRA
I lost my appetite.

She does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.
Two beats. He passes a silent burp.

MANNY
(trying to shift the mood)
So what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....

Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.

TONY
(ignoring the question)
Is this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?
You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
Is that what it's all about?

MANNY
It's not so bad Tony, could be worse....

TONY
(doesn't hear)
. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?
(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)
A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!

MANNY
(gently)
Tony, you're drunk.

TONY
...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it
man, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!

Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps
her plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.

ELVIRA
You sonufabitch! You fuck!

They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
around to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food
off himself.

ELVIRA
How dare you talk to me like that!
You call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!

The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.

Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.

TONY
Sit down before I kill you.

ELVIRA
. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons
around all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?
(in a softer tone)
Oh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...

Silence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's
this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
their lines.

TONY
(softly)
Go on, get a cab home, you're stoned.
(to Manny)
Manny.

ELVIRA
No, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't
even know it.

TONY
All right I'm stoned.

MANNY
(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)
Come on, baby.

ELVIRA
No, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...
(staring at Tony)
I'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.

Pause. She starts wobbling out.
Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.

TONY
Let her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.

Stumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.
Tony's eyes follow her. Pause.

The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
food, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food
and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

TONY
You're all assholes. You know why?
Cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.

He wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony
shakes him loose.

TONY
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.

He starts out, staggers.

TONY
So say good night to the bad guy...
You're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.

He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
and delight.

CUT TO
174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT
A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
moves into frame.

Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
under the car.

Tony looks:

175 ERNIE
down the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying
traffic, signals okay.

176 CHI-CHI
waits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.

Tony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
snort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
under.

Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
axle of the car.

177 ERNIE
signals.

178 TONY
sees it.

A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
towards us.

Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
Tony hurries to the car, bends down.

TONY
(Spanish)
Psst! La Jara! Apaga.

The Shadow douses it and freezes in position.

Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.

Tony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.

TONY
Hey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?
Jesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.

FEMALE COP
Why don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....

TONY
The ASPCA? What's that? ...Jesus, that's not the place where they chop these dogs up is it?

FEMALE COP
(in a hurry)
Look it up in the Yellow Pages okay, buddy.
(signal to her partner, they drive off)

Tony looks at them go, takes another snort, walks over to
the car, bangs on the hood several times.

TONY
Hey smiley, come on outta there, you're under arrest!

178 CONTINUED 178
Pause. The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.
gun drawn, glowing with perspiration. When he realizes it's
a joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck you doing!

TONY
(winks)
Hey that was close, hunh?

CUT TO
179 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - DAY - EARLY NEXT MORNING 179
Ernie, Chi-Chi, and the Shadow huddle cold and uncomfortable in the sedan, waiting -- eating pizzas and drinking beers. The morning has come down ice cold.

180 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK - DAY 180
At the phone booth up corner, Tony -- the unshaven, bleary-eyed -- is rapping on the phone.

TONY
. . . Yeah, _ yeah...nah, nah...you tell Sheffield keep his nose out of it, there's not gonna be no trial, I got everything under control, yeah... Have you heard from Elvira?

He waits, hangs up, snorts some more, impatient. He picks up the phone again, starts dialing.

181 INT. TONY'S NEW YORK SEDAN - DAY 18:
In the sedan, the Shadow peers over, angry, at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck's he doing now! That sonufabitch....

182 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK r DAY 18;
In the booth, Tony, snorting another nostril, moves back
and forth as the phone rings at the other end. Finally she
picks up.

ELVIRA'S VOICE
Yes?

TONY
Hello baby, how's Baltimore?..hey look Elvie, I been thinkin' 'bout us, you know and....

The phone goes dead. Furious he slams it back down, stalks back out to the sidewalk.

183 OMITTED 183

184 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 184
He gets in the driver'6 seat. The Shadow's next to him
with the radio transmitter, Chi-Chi, in the back. Tony, seemingly unaffected by the weather, reaches for an open pint of ice cream, starts eating it with a plastic spoon.
He alternates ice cream with coke through the scene;the
dashboard of the car cluttered with cartons of half-eaten
Chinese food.

The Shadow, disgusted with all this mess, restrains himself,
staring out at the street with a hate-filled expression,
saying nothing.

CHI-CHI
(concerned)
Everything okay Tony?

TONY
Yeah roses. Where is this fuckin' guy?
I don't got all day to piss away.

CHI-CHI
Probably fucking his wife.
(eating pizza)
Jeezus it's cold.

185 THEIR POINT OF VIEW THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
The door of the brownstone. No movement. Though now
there's increasing traffic on the street and passing pedestrians.

TONY
. . . we oughta shoot him when he comes
out the door, save a lotta bullshit.

186 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

CHI -CHI
What's so important about this guy anyway? What's he, a Communist?

TONY
(snorting through his mouth)
Nah he's no Communist. He's a kinda symbol, that's what he is.

CHI-CHI
What the fuck's that mean -- symbol?

TONY
It's like when you die, your life meant something to somebody, y'know? It wasn't like you just lived it for yourself, but you did something for the rest of the human race too...

Tony snorts another line -- seen through the rearview mirror.

CHI-CHI
(nods his head somberly)
Yeah?

TONY
Me, I wanna die fast. With my name written in lights all over the sky. Tony Montana. He died doin' it.

CHI-CHI
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony, you ain't gonna die.

TONY
(doesn't hear him)
...So I'll end up in a coffin. So what? The cockroach fires the bullet's gonna end up in a coffin just like me. But I lived better when I was here. And that's what counts.

Pause.

TONY
(nervous, to Ernie)
Ernie, what time?

ERNIE
Ten to.

TONY
(opening his door)
I gotta call Manny.

He starts out the door. The Shadow barks out something in
preemptory Spanish.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Sit down!

TONY
Hey, you don't tell me what to do, you,...

CHI-CHI
Tony, he's coming!

187 EXT. MATOS' STREET - DAY

Matos gets into his sedan a quarter block down from his front door.

191 XNT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

SHADOW

Tony breaks open a fresh vial.

TONY
(English)
Hey okay I don't give a shit where, okay, you can blow him up when you like okay, just tell me okay -- when you like.

The chatter comes out jagged, irritating the Shadow who
doesn't understand Tony's English anyway.

SHADOW
(Spanish; to Chi-Chi)
What's he saying! You tell him stay inside thirty metres of the car okay -- no more you just stay inside thirty metres.

TONY
(English)
Hey, okay, I heard you the the first time. One time okay. Just tell me one time.
(snorts)

SHADOW
(Spanish)
I tell you thirty metres okay! You understand, madre de dios, why this hop-head is driving!

CHI-CHI
Okay, okay.

TONY
(English)
Okay, okay, cool it willya, all right.

192 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos pulls his car out of the parking space.

Tony puts his car in gear, prepares to pull out when:

Tony, upset now, goes to his vial, snorts, turns sharply to
the Shadow.

TONY
Hey Chico, no fuckin' way! No wife, no kids! We hit this fuckin' guy we hit him alone okay.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
No! Mr. Sosa says we do it now.
We do it.

He has the strength of a born psychopath, brooking no other reality but his own. He stares a hole through Tony who gives way to his intensity, going into a slow angry burn at himself, putting the sedan in gear and going after Matos,
muttering to himself.

TONY
...aw fuck this, this fuckin' asshole!

Chi-Chi, in the back, looks on worried.

198 NEW YORK STREETS - DAY - FOLLOWING MATOS' SEDAN
through Manahattan, towards the UN.

The Shadow making the final adjustments on his decoder. He now sticks a key in it. A red light pulses at intervals.

Tony, driving, glances, the tension building in him, he
does another giant snort.

Matos' sedan, swerving out into traffic to pass a car, has
a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
honking angrily after the bus.

The Shadow goes nuts, peering over the dashboard to see if
the bomb came loose.

SHADOW
(to himself, Spanish)
Madre de dios, my bomb! -- don't you fuckin' fall, my little baby!
Perspiration starting to break out on his forehead.

Tony also feels the sweat coming on.

TONY
(muttering)
...this is fuckin' crazy, man, this is sloppy doing it this way, you
don't do it like this....

He honks furiously at a cab that tries to cut him off.

199 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony, intense at the wheel, sneezing, his nose running.

Tony honking his way through traffic after them, building
to a climax with himself.

TONY
(muttering)
...bunch of fuckin' vultures. You don't have the guts to look 'im in the eye when you kill him, you gotta hide, you fuckin' vulture.

Honk, honk.

SHADOW
Shut up!

CHI-CHI
(suddenly panicked)
He's gonna get out! Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

TONY
(ignoring all the commotion)
makes you feel good, hunh?
Killing the wife and the kids. Big man. Well fuck you! What do you
think I am? You think I'd kill two kids and a woman. Well fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life.

His face twisted in agony, he reaches down and snaps his Beretta free from his ankle holster. He swings it around sharply, leveling it on the Shadow.

TONY
Motherfucker!

The Shadow glances over at Tony, astonished. Tony pumps
two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and
smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood
and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers.

CHI-CHI
Oh Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the....

Tony swerving the sedan back across the Avenue, the traffic
around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as
the Shadow's body slumps down out of sight, another Monday
morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered
up against a passenger window and nobody really sees...
except a six-year-old girl in an adjacent vehicle; she
wonders momentarily, then dismisses it.

TONY
(continuing to mutter)
...so what'd you think I was, hunh?
A fucking worm like you! I told you don't fuck with me! I told you no kids! You shoulda listened to me you stupid fuck!

Planes roaring.

210 INT. JFK AIRPORT
Chi-Chi waiting in a busy lounge covering Tony on the phone;
Tony's still wearing the same clothes with patches of blood
on them.

TONY
Ernie? Where the fuck you been?

ERNIE'S VOICE
I had a delivery. Tony, everything go okay, whatsa ---

TONY
Fuck no? Where the hell's Manny? I been calling all over.

ERNIE'S VOICE.
I don't know, Tony. He's been gone last couple of days. Didn't say nothing.

TONY
What! Where! I left that sunufabitch in charge! What the hell is going on here, can't I trust anybody anymore.

ERNIE'S VOICE
I don't know, Tony, he just took off, y'know, he didn't say nothing...
you all right?

TONY
No, I'm not all right. I'm pissed off! And when I 'get there I'm gonna kick some ass all over the fuckin' place!

ERNIE'S VOICE
When you coming back, Tony?

TONY
Tonight!
(repeating to himself)
Where the hell is that cocksucker?
I can't trust nobody no more. You think just cause I'm a nice guy....

ERNIE'S VOICE
Uh, Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone. She got to see you right away.

TONY
Gina's gone? Where! Oh fuck! ...Tell her I'll be there tonight. Okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Right.

TONY
(about to hang up, pauses)
uh -- how 'bout Elvie -- did she call?

ERNIE'S VOICE
(a beat)
No.

TONY
Yeah, okay, okay... listen if she calls, tell her I love her, okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Yeah, okay Tony.

Tony hangs up. A moment of despair. Then he snorts
another spoon and snaps back.

211 EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 211
Plane taking off.

CUT TO
212 EXT. TONY'S MANSION - THAT NIGHT 212
Tony drives up in a white Corniche (the red Jaguar having been shot to shreds earlier in Lopez's attempt on Tony's life) with Chi-Chi, jumps out in the same bloodstained clothes, rushes in.

213 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 213
Ernie meets them at the door.

TONY
Hear from Manny?

ERNIE
No Tony. Your mama called again.
She gotta see you. And Sosa's been ringing every half-hour on the eleven line. Tony, he sounds pissed, he....

TONY
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Chi-Chi, get him on the line. In the office.

Chi-Chi goes.

TONY
What about Elvie -- anything?

Ernie shakes his head.

TONY
You keep trying Manny. I need that cocksucker, you hear, I need him here! Okay?

ERNIE
Right, Tony.

Tony stalks off, towards his office.

214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE

Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
and stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.

TONY
Yeah? Hi. Mami.

Her voice on the phone sounds hysterical and angry.
The other phone is ringing.
Not really listening, Tony breaks open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.

Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.

TONY
(into the phone)
Yeah, all right. I hear you. I'll be there!
No problem, okay.

He hangs up, snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi indicates.
The telephone should be the latest in gimmickry.

TONY
. . . so whaddaya say Alex?

Pause. The voice at the other end is very controlled, very
cold.

SOSA'S VOICE
So what happened Tony?

TONY
(casual)
Oh we had some problems.

SOSA'S VOICE
Yeah, I heard.

TONY
How'd you hear?

SOSA'S VOICE
Cause our friend gave a speech today at the UN. He wasn't supposed to give that speech.

TONY
(shrugs)
Yeah, well, your guy Alberto was apiece of shit, he didn't do what I
said so I cancelled his fuckin' contract.

Pause at the other end.

SOSA'S VOICE
e . . M-y partners and I are pissed off.

TONY
Hey Alex, no big deal. There's plenty other 'Albertos'. So I'll
deliver the goods next month.

SOSA'S VOICE
(suddenly angry and letting Tony know)
No! We can't do that. They found what was under the car, Tony. And our friend's got security now up the ass. And the heat's coming down hard on me and my partners.
There's not gonna be a next time. You blew it, you fuckin' dumb cocksucker!

TONY
Hey, you don't talk to me like that!
Who do you ---

SQSA' S VOICE
(simultaneous)
I told you a long time ago, you little fuckin' monkey, not to fuck me and....

Tony holding the mouthpiece away from his ear and talking at it like it was a face.

TONY
Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to, hunh! Whatta you think
I am? Your fuckin' slave! You don't tell me what to do, Sosa. You ' re
shit! You want a war, you got it?

Slams the phone down.

TONY
The fucking nerve of that guy!

In the cavernous silence of the room, he listlessly turns to another line of coke.

CUT TO
215 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 215
Tony in the backseat in his white Corniche staring straight
ahead. Ernie driving, Chi-Chi with him.

216 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - NIGHT 216
The bulletproof white Corniche pulls up, Ernie and Chi-Chi
getting out first, checking the street, Tony following quickly.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
You try Manny again. Gimme five minutes.

He hurries towards the house.

217 INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21:
Mama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than
previously, as if overwhelmed by events.

MAMA
. she got a place of her own, she don't tell me where. One day I follow her in a taxi. She goes into this fancy house in Coconut Grove.

TONY
The Grove? Where'd she get that kinda money?

You ! You were giving her the money, what do you think -- don't you see what you do to her, don't you....

TONY
I never gave her that kinda money.

MAMA
Yes, you did! One time. One thousand dollars you gave her!...

TONY
Mama, was there a guy with hex?

MAMA
I don't know, there was this other car in the driveway. I know if I went in there, she'd kill me, she's like you, she....

Tony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother
by the shoulders.

TONY
Where's this house, tell me!

MAMA
Citrus Drive. Four hundred something.
Four hundred nine. You gotta talk to her Tony, she don't listen to me anymore. She says to me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'
Exactly like you do to me. Ever since you come back, she's been getting this way.

He turns to leave but she clings to his arm.

MAMA
Don't you see what you do to her?
Don't you see? Why do you have to hurt everything you touch, why do you....

TONY
(shakes himself loose, turns on her)
No! You know why she left, Mama?
Not cause of me. Cause of you.

MAMA
Me?

TONY
Yeah, it's you drove her nuts withyour nagging and bitchin'.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Nagging and bitchin'? I only demand a little respect and dignity in this house, is that why I am nagging and bitchin'?

TONY
(continuing)
...and you did the same thing to me. I wasn't this, I wasn't that --
never good enough for you. I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing!

MAMA
(interrupts)
. . . because I was putting food on the table, because I suffered for both of you....

TONY
First time I ever needed you, where were you?. . .

MAMA
Where was I?

TONY
...when I was in that Army jail in Cuba, rotting my ass off, not once.
I hadda come out into the fuckin' streets to find out my mother and my sister are gone from my house, they left the country, not one word, one letter, that's right.- Where were you?

MAMA
(interrupts)
You ! ..sin verguenza. From the time you were five, you gave me heartbreak and humiliation and shame....

TONY
That's right! That's right. What did you expect!

MAMA
(interrupts)
.that's what you brought into this
i&use. If I were to listen to you, you would convert my house into your gangster headquarters....

TONY
What do you expect now? To be loved?
You got no love in you, Mama.
What do you think Papi left for? And Gina? At least I didn't walk around with my head hanging down between my legs my whole fuckin' life. Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Somebody? You're proud? You're a
(Escoria!)
nothing. You're an animal!

Tony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.

MAMA
God help me, what have I done to you?
You were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....

Tony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.

218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218
Tony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly
closing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips
open her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the
doorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony
takes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.
CUT TO

219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219
Tony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies
the house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,
not calling attention to itself.

Tony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the
crystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
Wait here.

He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.
Hold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.

MANNY
(surprised)
Tony?

Tony stares, stunned.
Gina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a
big smile of welcome for her brother.

GINA
Tony!
(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)

Tony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.

Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.

MANNY
Hey Tony, c'mon we was....

The gun fires.

GINA
Tony! No!

Tony fires a second time.
Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.

Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.
Manny lies at his feet, dead.

GINA
Manny!

She goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.

GINA
Manny!

She looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.

GINA
You killed him?

Shaking her head at him incredulously.

GINA
We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.

Tony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.

GINA
Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?
What'd he do?

She hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes
horrible strangled sounds with her throat.

Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.

CHI-CHI
Tony, come on. We gotta get out of here
(to Gina)
Come on baby...Gina!

Suddenly she goes berserk.

GINA
Noooooooooooo!

And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.

Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.

220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220
Lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.

Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
the pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.

ERNIE
(to Chi-Chi)
Get the body!

Tony, back at the door, looks down again.
The eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.

Chi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.

CHI-CHI
Tony!

Pulls him. Tony snaps out of it.

TONY
Yeah!

He goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.
Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.

The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.

GINA
Manny! ...Manny! No!

CUT TO -
221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221
The white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.

222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222
It goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,
gravel flying.

The camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the
shadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.
Eight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.

223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223

Tony, scratches across his face, strides through the front
door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting
for them at the door.

Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.

CHI-CHI
What do we do with her Tony?

TONY
Do what? Where? Put her upstairs.
Put her in my bedroom.
(to Gina)
It'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take
care of you....

She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.
They trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.

224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224
Tony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.
Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.

Ernie and Chi-Chi come in.

CHI-CHI
We got some pills into her, she's cooling down.

Tony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.
Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.
Pause as he lets it sink in.

CHI-CHI
(worried)
Boss, what we gonna do now?

TONY
Do? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.
We gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that
fucker down.

Ernie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.

CHI-CHI
(eyeing the coke)
Hey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?

Tony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.
Ernie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.

Tony starts on another trek along the coffee table.

CUT TO
225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225
The Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.
A monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.
The monkeys listen quietly.
The flamingoes flutter.
. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...

. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.
. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
balustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically
catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

TONY
(insensate)
. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....

His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.
Tony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!

TONY
...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...
Well what the hell happened, hunh?
What the hell happened to us?...

In far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:

The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring
out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.

Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.

A third monitor carries another image of shadows moving
through the trees on the estate.

On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
incoherent.

TONY
...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would
you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...

As Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:

TONY
...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....


226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226
As he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.
Tony sees her.
She steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her
brother.

GINA
Is this what you want Tony?...

Tony shocked.

GINA
You can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.

She fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.

The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.

GINA
I'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.

Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.

GINA
Come and get me Tony. Before it's too late.

He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
distance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.

GINA
Come on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:

A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.

Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---

ERNIE
Get outta here!
Tony, they're everywhere!

Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.

TONY
(gently)
Hey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.

Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.

TONY tx:
Come on Gina, get off the floor.
You're all dirty now, you need a bath...
Mami's gonna be angry baby
-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..
Come on open your eyes my baby,
open your eyes.. -give me a smile.

There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.
One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
pounding it.

CHI-CHI
Boss ! Hey boss. Open up!

On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
goes off, blows him up against the door.

TONY
Cheeee!

He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.

On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.

Tony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,
talking to himself.

TONY
So you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.

Karroooomph!
The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.
It sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.

Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

TONY
Whores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?

Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.

TONY
Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!

Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.
A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
away. Laughing like a madman.

TONY
You need an army you hear! An army to kill me!

Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.

TONY
Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!

The Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.

Tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior
swimming pool below.

He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.

As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.

The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:
""THE WORLD IS YOURS""
And so, for the brief moment, it was.

Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,
panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the
wealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word ""Chivato"" in blood on the outside walls,
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay

I'm living proof the Messiah can die and be resurrected
I survive, y'all crucifying me for my message
Might, pull up in a Lam' to silence you I'm a shepherd
My truth, overrule my desire to be respected
Still, connected from South Africa to Singapore
My steppers don't play games this ain't DDR
Your shooters only on Call of Duty, I'm from a real warzone
You get blown with no chance to respawn
Fuck y'all on? Niggas sayin' they gon' have me murked
I could merch, it ain't gon' happen like a DJ Khaled verse
I'm from the Stones, Excalibur
If my demons charge then you'll be dodgin' Magnums out a Challenger
They throw shots in the air call it mazel tov
And hit you while your bae watch, now you're Hasselhoff
School of hard knocks, y'all niggas cap as a tassel toss
Damage the pussy like a lateral then I pass her off
I'm so, inappropriate, she chokin' it
Ethiopian chick, I'm diggin' in her Fallopian
I meditate like a monk, on the keys I'm Thelonious
None of y'all niggas close to me, I got claustrophobia
Salty niggas watch your sodium
They wanna murder me for my words like, Malcolm at the podium
Waldorf Banksy Hotel or the Astoria
I'm Inglorious like a bastard on Maury or
Judge Judy, fuck the judge and the jury
I'm walkin' through your hood wit' a fuck-ton of jewelry
Let a nigga reach, I teach, it's just me vers' me
I'm MJ in the 45 vers' 23
28, I made it past the 27 Club
Started a legal cannabis bud, I'm still selling drugs
93, only black plant in the dispo
Guess, every cloud got a silver lining like Sisqo
We kick door, industries where we was blackballed
Trappin' out the storefront, I used to play the backyard
Praise the most, Allahu Akbar, you act hard
My niggas runnin' up with them tools like it was Nascar
Only rapper with a Teflon in a Telfar
I got niggas with black tar and niggas with black cards
At Hov house in Malibu, I'm the most wanted
I'm the truth, that's for real nigga, no frontin'
I got a lot of beef like I had four stomachs
So I keep a 4-4 by my Goyard luggage
Wit' more G's than a Gucci bag
Play with me, I put them VL's on your head like a Louis hat
I got westside connections like Dub C
Plus more enemies in the public than Chuck D
She be sellin' pussy but I'm fuckin' for free
I ain't a trick daddy, nah nigga fuckin' wit' me
Understand, this is not a phase, I did the rock shit
I still got that crack Franklin and Snowfall shit
I'm doper than the Contras and the CIA
They killed the hood wit' it, then they killed JFK
The same way they tried Castro in Cuba
Went to Congo, assassinated Lumumba
Dipped in Ghana and deposed Kwame Nkrumah
These is just the facts of the past, this not a rumor
Fuck the pigs, Pumbaa, I'm cool bruh
I ain't dancin' for these white folks, Zumba
On your medulla for that coin, now you a Koopa
I degrade Freddy Krueger
Back out the Gulag, no Uncle Luke, my crew too live
On blocks where they handin' out nines like my shoe drive
I'm super fly like Curtis, fuck how you may feel
I smack a nigga, like Murda Mook, or Jae Millz
They say wise men don't argue with fools
And don't dance with the devil unless you ready to walk in his shoes
I put, pedal to the metal with the balance of a rebel
Every single sentence is a letter to the ghetto
Where the Section 8 mothers is struggling off a Link Card
Most father figures in prison or in the graveyard
Tryin' to find work on the Green Card
The AR put the dot next to your top, where's Jay Rock?
I'm way far, meeting with the Mandelas
Underneath Table Mountain in the beaches of Cape Town
I'm going Khabib Nurmagomedov with the takedown
Dangerous as heroin needles on playgrounds
That's the environment in which I was raised
Violent as rabid dogs, flow sicker than strays
I'm programmed to my ignorant ways
So beware wit' a minotaur should you choose to enter the maze
Went missing in, action, took five, like Jackson
Watched the wack shit festering in my absence
This fame will make you hallucinate like absinthe
We do it major, you niggas minor as infractions
Like a diamond miner in Congo, I'm conflicted
Do I play the role or continue living unscripted
I keep landin' ahead of my time like a flight to NY from LA 'cause of the time difference
Every line of every sentence is pivotal
I'm Lazarus in the last days, this shit is biblical
It's V, I'm Odysseus on my Odyssey
I'm in the Hamptons sippin' on a Long Island iced tea, fucker
Like I married the coco, Khal Drogo
I'd rather be deaf than hear y'all shit, it's so-so
Only nigga snap like me, must be Jermaine Dupri
I'm Jamie in Django that means free
Maya Angelou in a trap full of caged birds
My shit bunkin' like the 15th and the 1st
Dunkin' like Tim, could've been the '03 Spurs
My chick in three quarter length mink furs
Yves Salomon from Champs Élysées
Still take a bird to the drive thru at Chick-Fil-A
Breasts out in the coupe with somethin' thick in the legs
You tell me what came first, the chicken or the egg? Ah
My assessment's in the highest percentile
I feel like the chosen one surrounded by gentiles
German engineering on the Glocks and whips
With a Chinese chick in rush hour like Juntao
Push it to the limit, my port of Miami Zos
Rock, Voodoo beads, do ceremony with skulls
They'll sacrifice you then pray to your bones
Blow up, your whole block like a Syrian drone
I'm up top with a bird's eye view, ready to drop shit
Hairpin trigger extended in fiber optics
The ops, get a synopsis, can't say too much
Don't want to end up like Martha with them stock tips
I'm more Siddhartha, Buddha in his early stages
They say it's a law but move my mule, I need my 40 acres
Who wanna tango and dance? I'll have your mans
Pourin' out drinks for you champ, word to Noreaga
From the home of Capone and Minister Farrakhan
Black entrepreneurs homie, shiftin' the paradigm
With two certified 10s, that's a pair of dimes
Face down from the waist down 'til I'm paralyzed
Moroccan beauty wanna do me in Marrakesh
I'm Gil Scott but my revolution is televised
Word to the wise, you should be terrified
How can you threaten death with a man who already died?
Save Money still alive and breathin'
I'm the original, Adam in the Garden of Eden
I rose from the ashes, how could you bury a phoenix?
My name legend as if I was married to Chrissy Teigen
These days in the streets, get rich or die tryin'
Either go hard in the paint, or sit on the sidelines
I'm on a death race like drive-bys on I-95
I'm Dylan, I want every spot in the top five
I can see telepathically, niggas ain't even half of me
They all scrubs, Jesse Williams, Grey's Anatomy
I'm in you like a slave mentality
I'm the god, I was raised in Nazareth, they gotta hate me, they Pharisees
Hamdulillah survived in Chiraq
Where the violence surrounds your vision like IMAX
I'm on network TV but play me and catch a clip
Be on the next murder mystery series on Netflix
Industry in shambles, I gotta lead by example
Niggas scared to tell the truth, out of fear of getting cancelled
Cool, I'm the one that put my life on the line
Saving the game like I'm on the frontline with Private Ryan
Still, I feel like they withholding my respect
Like Uncle Sam withholding O's outta your check
Look, most niggas I know in debt
Gettin' stains for simple things, designer clothes, diapers and rent
2018 they tried to assassinate me
50 racks on my top, not no rap game beef
Shit got funky, I called General Kumasi
I was on Slauson with OG Blue from Long Beach
Niggas die young or you live and you learn
We called Big U, watched as niggas did a U-turn
This around the time I did the video with the dress on
I still had that burner on deck, like Steph arm
Not to mention, more bitches than I could count
24 have fivesomes with millions in my account
Your spouse, in multimillion dollar houses
I'm still ballin' on niggas that's game, blouses
It's just a sign of the times
You can't marginalize me, I'm livin' out of your lines
Menace to sobriety, anti-society
Selassie flow, y'all gotta speak of me higher-ly
Low center of gravity in the Lambo seats
Flyin' business international like Amnesty
Blood on the money like Israeli arms dealers
Still screamin' out free Palestine, nigga
30 got more shells than a whole family of armadillos
Jane Goodall, I be with gorillas
You won't see my killers nor will you hear 'em comin'
Now you Hellen Keller, call them boys Philip 'cause they drummin'
Me, I'm on base like a timpani
This a stroke of genius, Mozart's fifth symphony
Boxing like Tyson but I'm actin' like Cicely
I got mob ties like I had family in Sicily
It seems the world has succumbed to sensitivity
They tryin' to censor me 'cause they can't make sense of me
I'm still Save Money, send my cheese where the Swisses be
The Tiffanys, make a thot come like an epiphany
This is immaculate conception
I'm goin' in like I'm black and fit the description
Y'all spit opinions, the facts, often different
My shooter rock a mask, Rip Hamilton on the Pistons
Drippin' D'Ussé, libation fallen soldiers
Celebrate to see they son become winner like autumn's over
In the field where the fathers ain't coach us
We got God inside us, that's how Mary had Jesus without Joseph
Pray one day I have seeds, I'll teach 'em these lessons
Written language and paper was really Egypt's inventions
They killed the natives with disease and infection
Section 8 housing, now we got 8 bottles of Ace in our section
You do the math, all off of sixteens on these records
23 I saw my first M, like when you first heard Slim
Since him back like Mike with the .45
If you could add, that's no surprise, I keep it a hundred
And I'm still in the streets whippin' 350 AMG
One thing left in the trunk, I feel like Amerie
All the ops laggin' behind us, they got latency
They know it's gon' be violence like a orchestra, they play with me
I orchestrated enterprises from direct deposits
Niggas love to say I flopped but I was really catchin' charges
With the steppers on some Stomp the Yard shit
I made her cum louder but I never took a step in college
I said that before, y'all never caught it
I'm still a hooligan, grown and developed like Hoov' 'n 'em
Sending Jeff Fort bread in the same fed that Hoover's in
Ya' squad full of geeks, don't make me bring the trouble shooters in
Y'all judge y'all successes by the likes and mentions
I judge mines by the lives that my mic affected
Securus Calls nine to five from inside corrections
Bro said it made him shed a tear to hear me talkin' reckless
I rhyme for every child neglected
EBT users and students swiping Link Cards for breakfast
2018 they tried to stop the message

I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

Girl, girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_Walkin%20Shoes_The%20Gerry%20Mulligan%20Quartet%20Chet%20Baker.ttl,James Joyce,Ulysses (Chap. 10 - Wandering Rocks),"The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.

A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.

Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.

—Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?

Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.

Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.

—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.

Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.

Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.

—Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?

A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?

O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.

Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.

—But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.

The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:

—O, sir.

—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.

Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.

Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.

Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?

Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?

A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.

Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.

Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.

A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.

Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.

Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.

Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.

Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.

Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.

On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.

Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.

At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.

Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.

It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.

Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.

Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.

From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.

Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des Élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.

At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.

The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.

Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.

A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.

Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.

Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.

It was a charming day.

The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and homely word.

Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.

Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.

Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.

Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium.

He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.

A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.

Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.

Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.

Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.

Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.

—That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.

—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.

—It's very close, the constable said.

Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.

—What's the best news? he asked.

—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:

—For England...

He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:

—home and beauty.

J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.

A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.

He halted and growled angrily:

—For England...

Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.

He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:

—home and beauty.

The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying:

—There, sir.

Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.

—Did you put in the books? Boody asked.

Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.

—They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.

Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.

—Where did you try? Boody asked.

—M'Guinness's.

Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.

—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.

Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.

—What's in the pot? she asked.

—Shirts, Maggy said.

Boody cried angrily:

—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?

Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:

—And what's in this?

A heavy fume gushed in answer.

—Peasoup, Maggy said.

—Where did you get it? Katey asked.

—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.

The lacquey rang his bell.

—Barang!

Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:

—Give us it here.

Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:

—A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?

—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.

Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:

—Our father who art not in heaven.

Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:

—Boody! For shame!

A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.

The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.

—Put these in first, will you? he said.

—Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.

—That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.

She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.

Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.

H. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.

He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length.

—Can you send them by tram? Now?

A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's cart.

—Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?

—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.

The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.

—Will you write the address, sir?

Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.

—Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.

—Yes, sir. I will, sir.

Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.

—What's the damage? he asked.

The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.

—This for me? he asked gallantly.

The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.

—Yes, sir, she said.

Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.

Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.

—May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.

—Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.
He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.

Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.

—Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. É peccato. Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.

—Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.

—Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta.
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.

—Ci rifletterò, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.

—Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.

His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.

—Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.

—Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.

—Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!

Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.

Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.

The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.

Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:

—16 June 1904.

Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.

The telephone rang rudely by her ear.

—Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.

She scribbled three figures on an envelope.

—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.

—Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?

—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.

—Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.

The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.

—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.

—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?

—No, Ned.

—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.

—That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.

—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...

—Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.

In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.

From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.

—I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time...

—You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?

—Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.

—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.

He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford.

He stood to read the card in his hand.

—The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.

The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.

—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.

Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.

—God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.

The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:

—Woa, sonny!

He turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:

—Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.

With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.

—Chow! he said. Blast you!

—The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.

—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...

He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...

—I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!

Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.

—See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.

He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.

Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.

—See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?

He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.

—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.

—See? Tom Rochford said.

He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.

—I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.

—Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.

—Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin

Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.

—But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.

—Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.

He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.

—He's a hero, he said simply.

—I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.

—Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.

They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.

Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.

—The act of a hero, he said.

At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.

—This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain?

M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock.

—After three, he said. Who's riding her?

—O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.

While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.

The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.

—Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here.

They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker's cart.

—There he is, Lenehan said.

—Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.

—Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.

—He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.

Lenehan laughed.

—I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun.

They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.

—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...

—I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.

—Did she? Lenehan said.

A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.

He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.

—But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...

—I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...

Lenehan linked his arm warmly.

—But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.

He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:

—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?

His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.

—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.

Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.

—I'm weak, he gasped.

M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.

—He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.

Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.

He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.

—That I had, he said, pushing it by.

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.

—Them are two good ones, he said.

Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.

On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.

Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.

He opened it. Thought so.

A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.

No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.

He read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.

He read where his finger opened.

—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!

Yes. This. Here. Try.

—Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabillé.

Yes. Take this. The end.

—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.

Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.

Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for Him! For Raoul!). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!

Young! Young!

An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.

Mr Bloom beheld it.

Mastering his troubled breath, he said:

—I'll take this one.

The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.

—Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.

The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.

Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.

The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:

—Barang!

Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.

Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter.

—It's time for you, she said.

—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!

Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.

—Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?

He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.

—Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.

Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.

—Did you get any money? Dilly asked.

—Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.

—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.

—How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.

Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street.

—I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?

—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.

He handed her a shilling.

—See if you can do anything with that, he said.

—I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.

—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.

He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.

—Well, what is it? he said, stopping.

The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.

—Barang!

—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.

The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:

—Bang!

Mr Dedalus stared at him.

—Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.

—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.

—I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.

He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.

—Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.

Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.

—I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now.

—You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.

—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.

He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.

The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.

—I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.

The lacquey banged loudly.

Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:

—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!

From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.

I smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true? That's a fact.

Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up.

Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.

Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.

Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.

North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.

Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.

Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.

Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy.

Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.

Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.

Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.

Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.

Mr Kernan approached Island street.

Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.

Damn good gin that was.

Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.
At the siege of Ross did my father fall.

A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.

Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.

His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!

Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.

Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.

She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.

Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.

And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.

The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.

Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.

Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.

He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.

—Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.

Tattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curé of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.

I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.

Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.

Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:

—Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.

Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.

—What are you doing here, Stephen?

Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.

Shut the book quick. Don't let see.

—What are you doing? Stephen said.

A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. Nebrakada femininum.

—What have you there? Stephen asked.

—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?

My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.

He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.

—What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.

Show no surprise. Quite natural.

—Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.

—Some, Dilly said. We had to.

She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.

We.

Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.

Misery! Misery!

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.

They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.

—What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.

—Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.

—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?

—O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.

—With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.

—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.

He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.

—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!

He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.

—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.

Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.

As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:

—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.

—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.

Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:

—That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?

—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.

He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:

—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.

—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet.

—And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.

Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.

Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note.

—Aw! he said.

—That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.

—What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?

He turned to both.

—That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.

The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.

Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.

—Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.

—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.

Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.

—What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?

—He has, Father Cowley said.

—Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?

—That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?

—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.

He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.

—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.

—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.

The policeman touched his forehead.

—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.

He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.

Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.

—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.

—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.

—Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.

John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.

On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.

The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.

—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.

—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.

—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.

—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.

John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.

—I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.

They went down Parliament street.

—There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.

—Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.

Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.

John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.

—The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.

They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.

—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.

The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.

—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.

Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.

—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.

Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.

Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.

Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.

—What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.

Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.

—O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!

Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs.

—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.

With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.

—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.

—Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said.

Long John Fanning could not remember him.

Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.

—What's that? Martin Cunningham said.

All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.

—What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.

—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.

As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:

—Parnell's brother. There in the corner.

They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.

—Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.

—Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.

John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.

—I'll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress.

—Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.

When she had gone he said, laughing:

—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.

Haines opened his newbought book.

—I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.

The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:

—England expects...

Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.

—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.

—I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.

Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.

—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation...

—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.

Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.

—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?

He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.

—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.

—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.

He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.

—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on.

Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.

Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.

Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.

At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:

—Coactus volui.

He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.

As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.

—God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard!

Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.

After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.

Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.

In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.

No Sandymount tram.

Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.

His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.

Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.

William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cortège:

But though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.
Baraabum.
Yet I've a sort of a
Yorkshire relish for
My little Yorkshire rose.
Baraabum.

Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

*alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
[Interlude: John Lennon]
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_Indiana_Bud%20Powell.ttl,Stranger Things,Chapter One: The Vanishing of Will Byers Script,"Crickets are chirping. We see a shot of the night sky. A caption pops up, “NOVEMBER 6th, 1983/HAWKINS, INDIANA”. The caption fades away. The camera pans down to a government facility. Another caption pops up. “HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY/U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY’.
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY
Some lights are flickering. The camera pans down to a door. After a few moments, a man in a lab coat bursts through the door, running. Behind him, an alarm is sounding. Cut to him running through hallways. He eventually reaches an elevator and frantically pushes the button. The elevator begins coming down. He looks back down the hallway and then goes back to pushing the button. The elevator dings and opens. He gets in and pushes the button inside of the elevator. He stands for a moment, breathing heavily. A low growling is heard above him. He looks up and the growling grows louder. As the elevator doors close, he screams and is pulled upwards.
CUT TO: EXT. WHEELER HOUSEHOLD
A sprinkler is on outside. Cut to a wide shot of the house.

MIKE: Something is coming. Something hungry for blood.

Cut to Mike inside the house.
MIKE: A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
It is almost here.

The camera shows us Dustin, Lucas, and Will, before switching to a shot showing all four boys around a table. They’re playing Dungeons and Dragons.

WILL: What is it?

DUSTIN: What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.

LUCAS: It's not the Demogorgon.

MIKE: An army of troglodytes charge into the chamber!
Mike slams a figurine onto the table.

DUSTIN: Troglodytes?

LUCAS: Told ya.

They laugh. Mike suddenly looks nervous and looks around.

MIKE: Wait a minute. Did you hear that? That... that sound? Boom... boom... Boom!

He slams his hands on the table, startling the other boys.

MIKE: That didn't come from the troglodytes, no, that... That came from something else. The Demogorgon!

Mike slams another figurine onto the table.

DUSTIN: We're in deep shit.

MIKE: Will, your action!

WILL: I don't know!

LUCAS: Fireball him!

WILL: I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!
DUSTIN: Too risky. Cast a protection spell.

LUCAS: Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!

DUSTIN: Cast Protection.

MIKE: The Demogorgon is tired of your silly human bickering! It stomps towards you. Boom!

LUCAS: Fireball him, Will!

MIKE: Another stomp, boom!

DUSTIN: Cast Protection.

MIKE: He roars in anger!

WILL: Fireball!

Will throws some dice, but they fall off the table.

WILL: Oh, shit!

LUCAS: Where'd it go? Where is it?

They all get up from the table to search for the die.
WILL: I don't know!

DUSTIN: Is it a 13?

WILL: I don't know!

LUCAS: Where is it?

DUSTIN: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

KAREN: Mike! Mike!

LUCAS: Can you find it yet?

WILL: No, I can't find it!

KAREN: Mike!

Karen opens the door to the basement. Mike is at the bottom of the stairs.

DUSTIN: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

MIKE: Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

KAREN: You mean the end? Fifteen after.

She leaves. Mike runs up after her.

LUCAS: Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!

WILL: Why do we have to go?

MIKE: Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!

Mike walks into the kitchen, where his mom is. His dad fiddles with the TV in the background.

KAREN: It's a school night, Michael. I just put Holly to bed. You can finish next weekend.

MIKE: But that'll ruin the flow!

KAREN: Michael I'm serious.

MIKE: Mom, the campaign took two weeks to plan. How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?

KAREN: You've been playing for ten hours?

MIKE: Dad, don't you think that 20 more -

TED: I think you should listen to your mother. (He hits the TV and groans.) Dang dumb piece of junk.

Cut back to the basement.

WILL: Oh, I got it! Does the seven count?

LUCAS: It was a seven? Did Mike see it? (Will shakes his head.) Then it doesn't count.

The boys get ready to leave. Dustin picks up a pizza box.

DUSTIN: Yo, hey, guys. Does anyone want this?

LUCAS & WIL: No.

Dustin goes upstairs to Nancy’s room with the pizza. She’s on the phone with Barbara.

NANCY: Yeah. No, I don't think... Yeah, he's cute. Barb, no, I don't think so. Barb, you're not -

DUSTIN: Hey, Nancy. There's a slice left if you want it. Sausage and pepperoni!

NANCY: Hold on.

She puts the phone down and walks over to the door. Dustin smiles. She smiles and closes the door in his face. Cut to Dustin joining the other boys outside.

DUSTIN: There's something wrong with your sister.

MIKE: What are you talking about?

DUSTIN: She's got a stick up her butt.

LUCAS: Yeah. It's because she's been dating that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

DUSTIN: Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.

MIKE: She's always been a real jerk.

DUSTIN: Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

Lucas, Dustin, and Will begin riding away on their bikes.

DUSTIN: Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our Elder tree campaign.

MIKE: Four years ago!

DUSTIN: Just saying.

LUCAS: Later.

Will stays behind for a moment.

WILL: It was a seven.

MIKE: Huh?

WILL: The roll, it was a seven. The Demogorgon, it got me. See you tomorrow.

As Will catches up with Lucas and Dustin, the garage lights flicker. Mike turns off the lights and heads back inside. Cut to the other boys riding home. Lucas turns into his driveway.

LUCAS: Good night, ladies.

DUSTIN: Kiss your mom 'night for me. (To Will) Race you back to my place? Winner gets a comic.

WILL: Any comic?

DUSTIN: Yeah.

Will speeds ahead of Dustin.

DUSTIN: Hey! Hey! I didn't say ""go""! Get back here! I'm gonna kill you!

WILL: (As he passes Dustin’s house) I'll take your X-Men 134!

Will continues to speed away. Dustin stops in front of his house, panting.

DUSTIN: Son of a bitch.

Cut to Will continuing to ride. The camera pans to some signs on a fence he passes. One reads, “hnL/HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY/U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY”. A second reads, “RESTRICTED/AREA/NO TRESPASSING/U.S. GOVERNMENT/PROPERTY”. The light on Will’s bike flickers off. It flickers back on just in time for Will to spot a figure in the road. Will gasps and veers off the road, crashing.
He looks up at the road to see the figure turning towards him, with unnaturally long arms. He abandons his bike and runs into the forest. Cut to him reaching his house. He quickly runs inside and locks the door behind him. His dog barks. He looks for his family.

WILL: Mom? Jonathan? Mom?

He looks out a window and sees the figure approaching the house. He tries dialing 911, but all he receives on the other end is static.

WILL: Hello? Hello?

He sees the figure approach the front door. His dog continues barking, but backs away. The lock unlocks. Will runs to the shed behind the house, leaving the phone off the hook. He retrieves a shotgun from the wall of the shed and frantically begins to load it. He points it at the door, but after a few moments, hears growling from the back of the shed. He turns around and his eyes widen. The growling turns into screeching. The light in the shed gets brighter and brighter, until it suddenly stops, as does the shrieking. The camera cuts to a shot of the entire shed, now empty. The screen fades to black.
OPENING CREDITS
CUT TO: INT. HOPPER’S HOUSE
We see a child’s drawing of a kid and two adults next to a house. The camera slowly pans over various empty cans and trash to a TV, which is on.

DONNA: And that's it for News Center this morning. Thanks for joining us. Let's hand off now to Liz at the news desk.

LIZ: All right, thank you, Donna. Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county. Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark. The cause of the outage is still unknown. We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.

The camera continues panning to Hopper, who is asleep on his couch. Somewhere, a dog barks, waking Hopper. He sighs and looks at his watch. Cut to a shot of the lake, which then pans over to Hopper smoking on his porch. Back inside, he takes a shower, brushes his teeth, smokes some more, takes some pills, drinks some beer, and smokes even more. Cut to him putting on his police uniform, including his holster, his badge, and his hat. As he leaves, the camera pans back to the TV.

LIZ: In other news, you might wanna stay home tonight or at least pack an umbrella. We turn to everybody's favorite morning weather guy, Charles.

CUT TO: EXT. BYER’S HOUSEHOLD

JOYCE: Where the hell are they?

Cut to inside the house. Jonathan is making breakfast.

JOYCE: Jonathan?

JONATHAN: Check the couch!

Cut to Joyce searching the couch.

JOYCE: Ugh, I did. (She finds them) Oh, got them.

She enters the kitchen.

JOYCE: Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

JONATHAN: Yeah, see you later.

JOYCE: Where's Will?

JONATHAN: Oh, I didn't get him up yet. He's probably still sleeping.

JOYCE: Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!

JONATHAN: Mom, I'm making breakfast.

Joyce goes to wake up Will.

JOYCE: I told you this a thousand times. Will! Come on, honey. It's time to get up. (She finds that Will isn't in his room) He came home last night, right?

JONATHAN: He's not in his room?

JOYCE: Did he come home or not?

JONATHAN: I don't know.

JOYCE: You don't know?

JONATHAN: No. I got home late. I was working.

JOYCE: You were working?

JONATHAN: Eric asked if I could cover. I said yeah. I just thought we could use the extra cash.

JOYCE: Jonathan, we've talked about this.

JONATHAN: I know...

JOYCE: You can't take shifts when I'm working.

JONATHAN: Mom, it's not a big deal. Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day. I'm sure he just stayed over.

JOYCE: I can't believe you. I can't believe you sometimes.

Joyce picks up the phone and calls the Wheelers. Cut to the Wheelers eating breakfast, with the phone ringing in the background. Nancy watches Mike pour syrup on his food.

NANCY: That's disgusting.

MIKE: You're disgusting.

Karen picks up the phone.

KAREN: Hello?

JOYCE: Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.

KAREN: Oh, Joyce, hi.

Mike squirts syrup on Nancy's plate.

NANCY: What the hell, Mike?

TED: Hey!

KAREN: Quiet!

TED: Language.

NANCY: Are you kidding?

JOYCE: Was that Will I heard back there?

KAREN: Will? No, no, no, it's just Mike.

JOYCE: Will didn't spend the night?

KAREN: No, he left here a little bit after 8:00. Why? He's not home?

JOYCE: Um, you know what? I think he just left early for... for school. Thank you so much.

KAREN: Okay.

JOYCE: Bye.

KAREN: Bye.

Joyce and Jonathan exchange glances.
CUT TO: EXT. HAWKINS MIDDLE SCHOOL
Mike, Lucas, and Dustin bike to school. They lock their bikes up.

MIKE: That's weird. I don't see him.

LUCAS: I'm telling you, his mom's right. He probably just went to class early again.

DUSTIN: Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

Two school bullies, Troy and James, approach them.

TROY: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show. Who do you think would make more money in a freak show? Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

As he says this, he pushes the boys one by one. James looks pensive for a moment.

JAMES: I'd go with Toothless.

DUSTIN: I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in. It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

JAMES: (In a mocking voice) ""I told you a million times.""

TROY: Do the arm thing.

JAMES: Do it, freak!

Dustin cracks his arms. James and Troy groan and recoil.

TROY: God, it gets me every time.

Troy and James walk away, pushing the boys as they go.

LUCAS: Assholes.

MIKE: I think it's kinda cool. It's like you have superpowers or something. Like Mr. Fantastic.

DUSTIN: Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY AT HIGH SCHOOL

BARB: So, did he call?

NANCY: Keep your voice down.

BARB: Did he?

NANCY: I told you, it's not like that. Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me, but not like that. We just made out a couple times.

BARB: ""We just made out a couple times."" Nance, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous.

NANCY: No, I'm not.

BARB: You better still hang out with me, that's all I'm saying. If you become friends with Tommy H. or Carol -

NANCY: Oh, that's gross! Okay, I'm telling you, it was a one-time... Two-time thing.

Inside Nancy's locker is a note ""MEET ME IN BATHROOM. STEVE"".

NANCY: You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

She's leaving but then turns around...

NANCY: Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00. To study.

She leaves as the bell rings, Steve picks up his stuff.

Cut to: EXT, POLICE STATION

A van arrives at the police...

CUT TO: INT. POLICE STATION

...and its driver, Chief of Police Jim Hopper , enters the place.

FLO: Good of you to show.

After passing by receptionist Flo, he comes near the table where officers Powell and Callahan are playing cards.

JIM:Oh, hey, morning, Flo. Morning, everybody.

POWELL: Hey, Chief.

CALLAHAN: Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

JIM: Oh, yeah?

CALLAHAN:  Yeah.

JIM:Well, I looked better than your wife when I left her this morning.

FLO: While you were drinking or sleeping, or whatever it is you deemed so necessary on Monday morning, Phil Larson called. Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again.

JIM: Oh, those garden gnomes again. Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get right on that.

Jim picks up a donut and messes with the cards in Powell's hand.

FLO: On a more pressing matter, Joyce Byers can't find her son this morning.

JIM:Mmm. Okay, I'm gonna get on that. - Just give me a minute.

FLO: Joyce is very upset.

JIM: Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this. Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

FLO:  Chief, she's already in your....

JIM: Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

He enters the room, and, due to not paying attention, is surprised by Joyce already waiting.

Chief is now typing the file on Joyce's charges as she, clearly nervous, smokes for relief.

JOYCE: I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper.

JIM: And I apologize again.

JOYCE:I'm going out of my mind!

JIM: Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

JOYCE:No, not my Will. He's not like that. - He wouldn't do that.

JIM:Well, you never know. I mean, my mom thought I was on the debate team, when really I was just screwing Chrissy Carpenter in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

JOYCE:Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me. He's not like most. He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean. They make fun of him. They call him names. They laugh at him, his clothes...

JIM:His clothes? What's wrong with his clothes?

JOYCE: I don't know.Does that matter?

JIM:Maybe.

JOYCE: Look, he's... He's a sensitive kid. Lonnie... Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag.

JIM: Is he?

JOYCE:He's missing! Is what he is.

JIM: When was the last time you heard from Lonnie?

JOYCE:Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis. That was about a year ago. But he has nothing to do with this.

JIM:  Why don't you give me his number?

JOYCE: You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

JIM: Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing, the kid is with a parent or relative.

JOYCE:What about the other time?

JIM:  What?

JOYCE: You said, ""99 out of 100."" What about the other time, the one?

JIM: Joyce.

JOYCE: The one!

JIM: Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay? You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here in the four years I've been working here? Do you wanna know the worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because it thought that her hair was a nest.

JOYCE: Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie. He will talk to me before he talks to...

JIM: What, a pig?

JOYCE: A cop! Just find my son, Hop. Find him!

Cut to HAWKINS LAB, EXT

Cars arrive at the research facility. From them, emerge a team of scientists carrying briefcases, including...

SCIENTIST: Dr. Brenner.

...who shakes this scientist's hand.
Cut to HAWKINS LAB, INT

BRENNER: This way, gentlemen. The entire east wing will be evacuated within the hour. We've sealed off this area following quarantine protocol.

The team of scientists, including Dr. Brenner, suit up in protective suits, grab guns and flashlights, and go down an elevator, where they proceed to the quarantined underground subsystem. There, they find strange biologic growth spreading - originating from a mysterious fracture in the wall.

SCIENTIST: This is where it came from?

BRENNAN: Yes.

SCIENTIST: And the girl?

BRENNAN:She can't have gone far.

A growl is heard from the growth as we...
Cut to FOREST
...see two bare feet walking along the dry leaves. As they stop, the camera pans up to a young girl dressed in a hospital gown, with a completely shaven head. Then we cut to her point of view.

Cut to BENNY'S BURGERS, EXT

She's watching Benny Hammond, owner of the local burger joint, leaving through the back door to put garbage in the can outside. As he walks back, the girl is pensive.


Cut to BENNY'S BURGERS, INT

The girl enters the back door, passes by the pantry, and gets to see Benny serving a costumer.

BENNY: All right, and one more.

Hey, Ben. What do you think about that, uh
BENNY: Hey, I don't know.
-I don't know.
I don't know, 37 points per game average - Thirty-seven now, but
- Mr. Basket.

The girl enters the kitchen, eventually appearing by a basket of fries, which she starts to gobble. Benny eventually notices her...

BENNY: Hey! Come here!

...and she grabs the basket and tries running away, before Benny gets her just as she's about to leave through the door she came in.
BENNY:Hey, come here! You think you can steal from me, boy?

He then takes a look at the kid he just caught
BENNY: the girl,What in the hell?

Remember, finish chapter 12 and answer 12.

This will be on the test, which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

So, did it come? Sorry, boys.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it came.

Yes!

The Heathkit ham shack.

Australia? Oh, man! When Will sees this, he's totally gonna blow his shit.

Lucas!

Sorry.

Hello, this is Mike Wheeler, president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

What are you doing?

Hello, this is Dustin, and this is the secretary and treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club. Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

JIM: Okay, okay, okay. One at a time, all right? [points to Mike] You. You said he takes what?

MIKE: Mirkwood.

JIM:  Mirkwood?

MIKE: Yeah.

JIM:  Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?

CALLAHAN: I have not. That sounds made up to me.

LUCAS: No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

DUSTIN: Well, The Hobbit.

LUCAS: [mocking]""He asked!""

MIKE:  Shut up, guys!

JIM:  Hey, hey, hey!  What'd I just say?  Shut up. One at a damn time. [to Mike] You.

MIKE:  Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's just the name that's made up. It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

JIM:  Yeah, all right, I think I know that.

MIKE: We can show you, if you want.

JIM: I said that I know it!

MIKE: We can help look.

DUSTIN: Yeah.

JIM: No.
[the boys protest]
JIM: No. After school, you are all to go home. Immediately. That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating, no nonsense. This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

DUSTIN: The Hobbit.

LUCAS: Shut up!

- Hey!

JIM: Stop it! Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself clear?

of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.
ANCHOR (O.S.)
Outrage over an “African American

predominately white students of
Manchester University has resulted
in rioting and property damages.
2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue 2A
eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.
ANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Guests were invited to “liberate
their inner Negro, fry up chicken,
enjoy a sugar water concoction
known as Purple drank and wear
oversized Barack Obama T-shirts.”
2B COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts 2B

small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips. *
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Officials claim an investigation is
underway to find those responsible
for the event and subsequent riot.
2C SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an 2C
edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro
pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
In an effort to address diversity
issues, the school appointed
African American scholar Dr. Walter
Fairbanks as Dean of Students.
2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D
glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains
his otherwise boyish face.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Last year the Dean’s office
celebrated slight gains in diverse
applicants but with many now
calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
that may have been pre-mature.
2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E
50’s fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.

As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
checks his pockets. He’s missing something. Shit.
LIONEL
(knocking)
Kurt! You home?
Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel’s.
ANSWERING MACHINE
Hey boyssss, you’ve reached Lionel
Higginsss, the only bitch on

The beep sounds. Lionel’s in shock. Should he hang up? Or...
LIONEL
Kurt. It’s Lionel. I’m locked out.
As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It’s a rendering of Sam
White on a carton of milk with the caption:

SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, apparently

11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
Colandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes
right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She’s
got an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
...I am! The whole point of
randomized housing is to mix shit
up. I’m out here trying to find the

The video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a
30’s something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy
everything. Too stylish for this place. If he’s impressed,
it’s barely perceptible.
HELMUT
You call your Youtube show “Doing

He stares right at Coco, there in the flesh.

Coco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.
COCO
So what’s this show about anyway?
HELMUT
Here’s the way reality works

And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders

Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.

13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13
A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the

SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, thanks to the

The white sophomores nod their heads yes.
TROY (CONT’D)

TROY
Ya’ll take care. Nice Jordan’s bro.
Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette
who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.
SOFIA
Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.
COCO
You’re so cute.

Coco’s face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.
SOFIA (CONT’D)

Hey what house did you get?
SOFIA
Huh? Oh Bechet bitch.
COCO
Of course. The mere thought of a

Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile.

Sofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.

They turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new
Sophomores. Coco’s caught off guard by his looks.
COCO
Cute...

Troy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.
SOFIA
Hey boo. This is my friend Coco.
She’s new to the house.
TROY
Hey I’m Troy. Welcome to Armstrong

TROY
Head of House is always on duty.

Nice to meet you. I should get

Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down

You got it cut last week.

Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of
his dismissal.
They both spot Sam’s “Missing: Black culture” flyers.
TROY

SOFIA
You don’t have to run again. Just

bohemian and radical.
Troy glares at Sam’s picture on the book. It’s on. There’s a
history between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie’s laptop we hear...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, this just in.
Dating a Black person to piss off
your parents is a form of racism.
Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.
REGGIE
Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in
shucking or was it jiving?
TROY
My major’s in Jive. Minoring in
Shuck. You’re still majoring in

Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.
SOFIA
You need a shower.
15 INT. TROY’S BATHROOM - DAY 15
Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over

The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone
except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro’d bohemian
disciples (who we’ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the
proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.
REGGIE
That’s his platform? Haircuts?
SAM
Oofta is as Oofta does.
Coco, sneaks through the door. She’s got the eyes of Helmut

Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.
TROY
No but seriously, I care about you
guys. I care about this house. We
had a great year last year and if
it ain’t broke...
Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.
Sam doesn’t want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.
REGGIE
Just pretend like you’re in the
booth. Just you and the mic.
SAM
Hate this shit.
As Sam gets up and passes Troy --
TROY
You really think you can take this

SAM
Troy we live in a world where
there’s a Big Momma’s House 3. I

Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy my brother, it’s broke.
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy’s a legacy kid. And yet it’s
under his watch that Armstrong /
Parker, the bastion of Black
culture here was gutted. By the
Randomization of Housing Act.
Second years of color no longer
have a say in where they go. The
culture that’s been fostered in
this house for two decades will be
wiped out in two years.
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --
SAM (CONT’D)
This wasn’t motivated by a desire
to mix things up. Bring about
racial and socioeconomic harmony.
No, the Black kids are sitting
together in the proverbial
cafeteria and they must be up to no
good.
Coco’s eyes are in the back of her head.
SAM (CONT’D)
We sit together to protect
ourselves. Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations,
political leanings, majors, you
name it. Black folks get their own
house, suddenly we got a problem?
Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam
delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.
SAM (CONT’D)
This Act doesn’t affect the other
houses like it does ours. There are
plenty of trustees, former coaches,
and presidents watching out for the
others. All we have is a Dean who’d
rather please his massa --
TROY
-- Yo that’s enough of that Sam --
13.
SAM
-- then stand up for his own. Look,
I know ya’ll ain’t voting for me.
Ya’ll ain’t ready and I didn’t come
here for that. The Black Student
Union and I have brought a petition
to repeal the Randomization of
Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
to the President and together we
can bring Black back to Manchester.
It’ll be by the door.
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy
- give her daps and all sorts of praise.
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with
neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.
MARTIN
I assume everyone has the app I
created by now?
REGGIE
(aside)
It’s a child’s app...
MARTIN
Good. Voting may commence.
Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view
as he punches something in.
Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who
give him a head nod. Troy’s got this. After a moment...
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Okay. Looks like we’ve got
ourselves a winner.
(devastated)
Sam White?
The blood drains from Sam’s face and Troy’s smile plummets
into the floor as the two turn to look at each other.
TROY & SAM
Oh shit.
Reggie’s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and
slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.
17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17
Right on the heels of Helmut’s exit is...
14.
COCO
So that’s what you’re looking for?
HELMUT
I’m looking for good TV sister.
COCO
I think I’d be good TV.
HELMUT
You’re at a great school, getting a
great education. Be good at that.
COCO
I am. And when I graduate early
with an Economics degree from
Manchester it will be the crowning
achievement of my Black middle
class parents’ ambitions.
HELMUT
Conflict is a commodity in my
industry. Sam’s got it. Do you?
COCO
So you want me to start a fight.
HELMUT
(exactly)
I don’t want you to do anything you
wouldn’t otherwise do.
Helmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.
He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.
18 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 18
A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while
the message plays over speaker phone.
SPEAKER

Dean Fairbank’s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Most everything’s locked up, but

(off Lionel’s sigh)
What about Armstrong / Parker?
15.
LIONEL
I don’t know...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I might have an opening. Maybe it’d
be good to be around...you know.
LIONEL
Dean. The worst thing about high
school, and believe me it was a
long list, were the Black kids.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Maybe it’s in your head. Sure,
sometimes our folks can be
intolerant around people like you.
Homo --
LIONEL
-- I don’t believe in labels.
Fairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank’s desk: Students
of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy
with the phrase “MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG” printed below.
Troy’s huge smile seems to mock him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You like jazz Lionel? Manchester’s
like jazz you know.
LIONEL
This is a research school.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And jazz is tension. The interplay
of improvised solos all creating
one song. Your problem is you’ve
got no instrument. No major, no
affiliations, no solo son.
LIONEL
I submit articles to the
Independent Observer.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
No one reads the Independent
Observer, my point is are you
playing swing or bebop?
LIONEL
You’re mixing metaphors.
16.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?
LIONEL
I hate jazz.
Fairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll do what I can. Not a word of
this in the Observer okay?
LIONEL
What’s it matter? No one reads it.
19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
to..
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
trades “No Homo’s” with the others.
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...
GEORGE
Lionel right?
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from
Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
George. We had Civ last semester?
How you doing?
LIONEL

GEORGE
Fan of your stuff. In the Observer?
LIONEL
No one reads the Observer.

George hands Lionel Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyer.
17.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
The residents of Armstrong / Parker
just made her head of house. Am I
crazy or is there a there there?
LIONEL
What made you come over here?
George holds up Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy.” Lionel takes it.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean I’m glad you came --
GEORGE
-- My staff? God bless them.
They’re whiter than Michael
Jackson’s kids. We’re fucked if
anyone of them writes this story
and I will not let the transfers at
the Gazette do it first.
LIONEL
The oldest one has his face.
GEORGE
You’re in the Black Student Union.
You probably know Sam.
Lionel shakes his head “yes” and “no” at the same time.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
You come up with a good angle? I
want it in the Bugle.
Lionel eyes the bold “Bugle” logo on George’s shirt.
LIONEL
(aside)
Trumpet...
GEORGE
Bugle. Focus. The only paper on
campus with a national subscription
base and an Advisor from the New
York Times? Only so many ways a
person can distinguish themselves
at a place like this Lionel. You’re
good. You belong with us.
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we
know he’s never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn’t hurt there’s a handsome boy smiling at him either.
18.
20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their
opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall
between them.
TROY
Get it yet?
Sam shakes her head yes.
TROY (CONT’D)
Good. You’ve now got the shared
calendar, contacts, and official
email.
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack
of papers.
TROY (CONT’D)
Oh and before I forget.
SAM
Event requests for the year?
TROY
Just this month. They need your
approval. Also don’t forget to pick
your office hours. At least 20 per
week.
SAM
That’s absurd.
TROY
You’re in charge of a hundred
residents now. And they need time
to complain to your face. About
noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free
options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.
SAM
Troy. I didn’t think I was going to
win.
TROY
And by the way petitioning the
President on the Randomization of
Housing Act isn’t gonna do shit.
None of the other houses are
concerned.
19.
SAM
Because they all have a legacy of
rich and powerful allies on the
board who will make sure that
“random” works out to their
advantage.
TROY
And you think a petition is going
to change that?
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam’s
phone buzzes: “MOM.” The letters chill Sam to the core.
21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21
Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
with a notepad. He flips through Sam’s “EBONY & IVY” book...
SAM (V.O.)
The Armstrong / Parker dining hall
is the epicenter of Black culture
as it stands at Manchester. Only
here can you commiserate, celebrate
and discuss everything from Kanye
West lyrics to theoretical
relativism all in one sitting. Not
to mention find someone who can
actually do your hair.
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
lively and somewhat alien dining hall.
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
art major.
MARTIN
“We wuz robbed.” That election was
suspect man.
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.
SAM
You call me the minute there’s an
update. Love you too mom.
Sam hangs up. The call’s really put her in a bad place. She
sits at a table of her Bofros - who we’ll name by their hair.
20.
CURLS
There is one other sister in my
Relativity class, I’ll be damned if
our professor doesn’t call me
Laretta every God damn time.
DREADS
We all look the same.
REGGIE
Programming professor gets me and
Martin here mixed up constantly.
MARTIN
You should be so lucky.
Reggie glances over at Martin’s Mac Air.
REGGIE
Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?
Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
You still using your ID number?
SAM
I always forget passwords.
REGGIE
You are begging to get hacked.
SAM
Good thing the one evil technogenius
thinking like that is on my
side.
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.
SAM (CONT’D)
So this is what the revolution
looks like? Office hours and
paperwork.
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.
REGGIE
Winning was a happy accident. We
want the reform repealed right?
CURLS
Means to an end, sister.
21.
Sam feels the heat of her disciples’ eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.
COCO
The talented tenth always has to
bust its ass a little bit harder,
but I don’t see the benefit in
blaming white folks for everything.
CURLS
Who’s blaming?
TROY
I don’t see the issue. I never had
one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.
SAM
Lynch mob is still there. Just rebranded
itself.
TROY
As what pray tell?
REGGIE
The Republican party.
SAM
Want to know how this world sees
you? Go to a Young Republican’s
meeting and bring up Welfare.
SUNGMI
Or Immigration.
LIONEL
(aside)
Or gay equality.
KURT
Bullshit.
MARTIN
I agree. Got something to add?
KURT
The biggest athletes, movie stars,
hell your president is Black.
22.
(MORE)
Sometimes I think the hardest thing
to be in the American work force
right now is an educated white guy.
SUNGMI
You’re not serious.
KURT
You guys still got affirmative
action, you’re set.
REGGIE
This shit.
SAM
What are you doing in here?
KURT
Obama. Leader of the free world got
into Harvard on affirmative action.
Know who’s not president right now?
The guy that didn’t get in.
SAM
On behalf of the colored folks in
the room, let me apologize for all
the better qualified white students
whose place we’re taking up.
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.
SAM (CONT’D)
You get lost? Bechet is that way.
KURT
Yeah but what other dining hall
gives you chicken and waffles? Dear
White People right? Funny stuff.
How haven’t we staffed you yet?
SAM
On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor
magazine?
KURT
We’re a lot more than a magazine
sweetie. SNL staff is basically
half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just
like the network comedies.
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.
23.
KURT (CONT'D)
SAM
What gives you Clubhouse kids the
right to come to our Dining Hall?
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.
SAM (CONT’D)
You don’t live here.
MARTIN
Sam? What are you doing?
SAM
You can’t eat here.
Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.
TROY
Chill Sam damn. Let the man--
KURT & SAM
-- I got this.
KURT
Who are you to put me out?
SAM
(realizing)
I’m the Head of this house. And I’m
doing things my way.
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to
which Sam slams his tray to the ground.
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.
KURT
You got any idea who you’re --
SAM
-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.
The same one who’s been pushing to
break up this House for a decade.
What’s wrong? Is he scared letting
the Negroes gather in groups might
start a rebellion on the
plantation? You tell him from
me...he should be.
Kurt looks into Sam’s eyes and then his crew. They want out.
KURT
Bad move.
24.
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
snicker from Lionel which draws Sam’s eyes right to him.
Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
to GEORGE: “I’ve got the angle. I’m in.”
SAM
You too.
LIONEL
Me?
SAM
Is this your house?
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.
By the caution on Sam’s face it seems the first time she’s
ever heard this sound directed at her.
A slight envy boils in Coco.
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.
Locked out again.
23 INT. COCO’S ROOM - DAY 23
Coco scrolls Sam’s “Dear White People” Youtube page. 75K
Subscribers. She presses play on the latest video.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, stop dancing.
Two seconds. 600K views.
COCO
The fuck?
Coco exits and opens her own “TIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE” page. 2K
subscribers. Her latest video is at 10K views. Alright... She
presses record. Let’s the camera rest on her briefly...
COCO (CONT’D)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
(comes to mind)
So the other day, a girl had the
nerve to fix her mouth and ask me
if my hair was weaved.
(after a moment)
Weaved. Weaved bitch?
25.
(MORE)
First of all if you’re going to fix
your mouth to ask me something like
that, say it right please? It’s
weave. Noun. Present tense. Second
of all don’t assume just because
you see a sister with some hair
it’s a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a
bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out her own head I
wouldn’t have just overdrafted my
account paying for this shit but
that ain’t your business. Are those
your lips sweetie? Sweet heart is
that really your skin? These white
girls and these tans I swear to
God, they’re starting to look
darker than me.
Coco pauses it. Her mouse hovers over the check box next to
“private.” Instead she plays it back...and hits “publish.”
She clicks back through to Sam’s last video and hits “reply.”
As the red light on her computer’s web cam turns green...
COCO (CONT’D)
Dear White People. What do I think
about it?
24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24
Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam’s caller from
earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch...
...a Black and white 1920’s style silent movie, complete with
Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC.
SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN
A) OBAMA speaks at a debate
B) DIALOGUE CARD: “We are the change that we seek.”
C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit
D) DIALOGUE CARD: “HE’S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!”
E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in
white-face reacting. Until...
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM!
G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into
camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head.
26.
COCO (CONT’D)
H) Dialogue Card: “FIN”
PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a “seen it all before”
demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Does anyone have any comments
for Sam’s “Rebirth of a Nation?”
All of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT’D)
Gabe, go ahead.
GABE
I dig the “silent movie” thing, but
it’s a little self-congratulatory.
Light on story and frankly
thematically dubious.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Anybody else?
SAM
What?
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER
As students filter out of the class...
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Sam?
SAM
Before you say anything might I
remind you that I sat through Birth
of A Nation, Gone With The Wind,
and Tarantino week without protest.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
And might I remind you that I read
all fifteen pages of your
unsolicited essay on why Gremlins
is actually about suburban white
fear of Black culture.
SAM
The Gremlins are loud, talk in
slang, are addicted to fried
chicken and freak out when you get
their hair wet.
27.
PRESIDENT BODKIN
My only problem with your movie is
that it was late. The silent
projects were last semester Sam.
You were supposed to have emailed
your sound treatment over Summer.
SAM
I’ve been getting footage.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
This is your senior thesis Sam,
where the hell is your head at?
SAM
I’ve got Radio, BSU, this Head of
House thing --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Do you want this? Cause if not,
don’t waste my time here --
Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel.
SAM
-- Look this thing might as well be
my right hand Professor. I was busy
this summer that’s all.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
With everything but your major?
While your peers are taking
internships, making short films...
SAM
My dad. He’s sick. Had to go home.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
If you need some time off, take it.
But if you want to make it to next
semester --
SAM
-- I do --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Pull it together. This is
Manchester.
Sam wants this. It’s in her eyes as she holds her tongue.
25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25
Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys.
28.
SAM
Thematically dubious?
GABE
Well what was that supposed to be
about exactly?
SAM
You’re thematically dubious!
Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her.
SAM (CONT’D)
Since when do TA’s give critiques?
GABE
You invoke Minstrelsy for shock
value, but to what end?
SAM
To invoke the same feeling I get
when I turn on the TV and see some
so-called reality star shuck and
jive for ratings egged on by no
doubt white producers. Or the sassy
Black secretary with no backstory
or character development aside from
their skin color.
GABE
So it’s a tit for tat? *
EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY *
SAM *
You’re honestly saying that art *
can’t be reactionary? *
GABE *
You’re reacting to a work made *
almost a hundred years ago. *
SAM *
Yes because fear of Black men being *
involved in the United States *
Government is a completely *
antiquated concept. No social *
relevance whatsoever today. *
GABE *
Frankly I just think sometimes its *
better to hold a mirror up to your *
audience than to drop an *
ideological piano over their head. *
29.
SAM *
Frankly I just think works that *
deal with the African Diaspora *
through a post-modern lens are *
outright rejected unless they’re *
handled by a white artist. *
GABE *
African Diaspora? Really? *
26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26
The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs.
SAM
Blackface is alive and well in our
culture. Who primarily buys hip
hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta?
The same homogenized images of
Black people over and over again?
White people Gabe.
GABE
Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies?
SAM
We’re an underfed community. None
of this changes the fact that the
vibrancy, the complexity of Black
culture has been distilled into
commodities and marketing schemes
to be bought and sold--
GABE
--to the detriment of the so called
“real thing.” Got it.
And into a room...
INT. GABE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gabe slams the door.
SAM
I am indistinguishable from the so
called “urban” images used to amuse
and market to white America.
GABE
And the commodification of culture
is uniquely oppressive to Black
people?
30.
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans.
GABE (CONT’D)
So when Kanye raps about Louis V
and Rolexes and Classical Art,
exactly what exploited pocket of
Black America are those references
being mined from?
Sam can’t get her shirt off fast enough.
SAM
On your knees.
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy.
CUT TO BLACK.
27A INT. GABE’S ROOM - EVENING 27A
Sam’s eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips.
She’s surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the
outside spoon. They’re both naked. Her pompadour frayed.
GABE
What? You dream in “Cosby” again?
SAM
My hair was so straight. My sweater
so big. I told you about that?
Sam’s phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie’s photo pop
up. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn’t
answer. Silence as it hits her voicemail.
GABE
Hey so...this whole “Head of House”
thing. Congrats?
SAM
Yeah, it's…it's.
GABE
Weird, right? Never took you as a
student politician...
Reggie’s photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam’s eyes.
SAM
Yeah, well...
Sam rolls out of bed. Gabe thinks twice before he asks it.
31.
GABE
Sam? What are we doing?
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. Instead...
SAM
Fucking.
28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28
Reggie stares at Sam with stars in his eyes as she
effortlessly addresses the campus in between bits of jazz.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People. Please stop
touching my hair.
29 INT. GARMIN CLUB HOUSE - DAY 29
Lionel at an ancient oak dining room table listens to the
broadcast over his laptop. Makes studious notations...
SAM (V.O.)
Does this look like a petting zoo
to you?
Lionel gets an IM: “George: Hey handsome, how’s the story?”
To which Lionel writes: “Going great sexy.” Lionel deletes
“sexy” and replaces it with “:)” before hitting send.
29A BAR DIVIDE 29A
Across from Lionel is Kurt flanked by his eager but self
conscious right hand GORDON - and MITCH, swagged out varsity
crew captain and connoisseur of all things Black culture.
They wear “PASTICHE” gear, hunch over a glowing iPad and
scroll through a series of student group photos in the
Yearbook. Kurt stares off into space, turns up the GANGSTA
RAP playing from a nearby blue tooth speaker.
Kurt pours shots of Jack which Gordon eyes with caution.
GORDON
Kurt it’s three.
MITCH
Y.O.L.O. my nigga!
Everyone takes the shot.
32.
GORDON
We don’t even have our new staff
yet. Why are we planning this?
KURT
Everyone wants to be on our staff
that’s the easy part.
MITCH
We’re going to make staff bids on
Game Night, and the RSVP’s are
through the roof for that.
KURT
Yeah but Halloween is our premiere
party. The waitlist is already a
hundred deep and it’s going to take
a lot to outdo this summer.
MITCH
Cinco de Mayo was epic.
INSERT:
A black and white photo of Kurt and crew dressed in Sombreros
and Mexican stereotypes at a wild pool party. The title
reads... PASTICHE PRESENTS “WETBACK”
GORDON
How about the Young Republicans?
KURT
Too close to the Tea-Party.
INSERT:
Photo of Kurt and crew dressed as famous female political
conservatives - brandishing rally signs with misspellings and
cups of tea. The title reads... “PASTICHE’S TEA PARTY”
MITCH
Yo we need an East vs West hip hop
party. Get the honeys in here.
GORDON
“The honeys?” You’re from Vermont.
KURT
Guys what’s the Pastiche motto?
GORDON
“Sharpen thy sword.”
33.
MITCH
Our motto is a euphemism for
masturbation?
GORDON
It’s a reminder that satire is the
weapon of reason. So who on campus
is being unreasonable?
MITCH
Sounds like a reminder of how gay
you are.
GORDON
Was that even a reasonable attempt
at a quip Mitch?
MITCH
Hey Gordon, say reasonable again.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, knowing Lil’
Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an
Honorary Black Card. It just
reminds me how often you say the
word “nigga” when no one Black is
around as is required in reciting
said lyrics.
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs
headphones into his computer and looks down.
KURT
The hell does Sam think she is?
MITCH
Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a
pissed off baby.
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they’re leaning
towards the same idea.
KURT
Could we?
GORDON
How?
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.
KURT
Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean
today.
34.
(MORE)
We had a very enlightening
conversation. I just want to say...
I’m sorry about the voice message.
29B DINING ROOM 29B
Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel’s table. Kurt unzips
his pants silently.
KURT (CONT’D)
Do you accept?
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he
starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly
looks in the other direction. Kurt’s friends crack up.
GORDON
Please put that away.
KURT
You got to talk to these people in
a language they’ll understand.
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro.
LIONEL
Pathetic.
KURT
(yelling)
Wherever he ships you off to, be
sure to pack a sense of humor with
you, kay bro?
Lionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy”
book to a section called...
SAM (V.O.)
The Paper Bag Tests.
As Lionel reads we swish pan to...
30 DREAM DINER 30
...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST
SAM
The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly’s
for a snack. Your waitress mistakes
you for someone who looks like you
(Black) who once ran up a thirty
dollar bill and left a dollar tip.
35.
KURT (CONT'D)
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us.
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him.
SAM (CONT’D)
You watch all the other customers
order before you do...
Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel.
LIONEL
Pastrami sandwich on rye.
SAM
...then proceed to wait no less
than forty minutes for your food.
A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come.
SAM (CONT’D)
How do you tip? A...
LIONEL
Forty minutes? Man she’s lucky I
leave her forty cents. You do a
good job, maybe you’ll see a tip.
SAM
B...
LIONEL
Doris was tripping, but fifteen
percent is the least I can do.
SAM
Or C...
LIONEL
I reject the stereotype that
African American’s don’t tip. I’m
leaving her twenty, no twenty five,
just to prove I can!
CUT TO:
Lionel’s back in reality. He ponders the scenario.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
C?
He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on
the bottom of the page. “A) ONE HUNDRED” “B) OOFTA” and his
answer “C) NOSE-JOB.”
36.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Nose-job?
31 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 31
The campus has settled into the semester as students trudge
back and forth to class.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People in a shocking
reversal using the term “African
American” is borderline racist now.
32 INT. DEAN FAIRBANKS OFFICE - DAY 32
Dean Fairbanks and PRESIDENT HERBERT FLETCHER, 50’s in an
even better suit than Fairbanks listen to the radio.
Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two.
SAM (O.S.)
Turns out if you’re too worried
about Political Correctness to say
“Black”, odds are you secretly just
want to call us niggers anyway and
truth be told I’d rather you just
be honest about it.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Free speech my ass.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Stalin quotes for two hundred?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
You’re joking about this?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sorry, was I supposed to take
“Free speech my ass” as a
legitimate suggestion?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
This is your office’s issue Walter.
Especially after that episode with
Kurt in the dining hall.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Every race issue is my issue.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
It’s a student issue. You are the
Dean of students aren’t you?
The two share an old and heated glare.
37.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
The Times has been watching us like
a hawk. Last thing we need is some
“race war” on newspapers across the
country. How do you think our donor
base will feel about that? Our fundraiser
is four weeks away.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
How bad is this deficit of yours?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Worse. But let me tell you
something. If this blows up any
further? It’s on you Walter. Racism
is over in America. And if anyone’s
still dealing with it, it’s the --
I don’t know Mexicans probably.
Troy pokes his head in. Fairbanks cuts the radio off.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Come on in.
TROY
President Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Son, call me Herb.
Fairbanks grits his teeth as Fletcher exits and Troy sits.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
President Fletcher tells me his son
got his ass handed to him.
Troy hates this game.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Bout time. Can’t tell you how many
instances I had to defend Armstrong
/ Parker when I was Head of House.
TROY
Sam’s out of line. Kurt’s alright.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you’re supposed to be better
than alright. Since when do we lose
elections Troy?
TROY
The Housing Act passing without a
fight didn’t help.
38.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What have I told you about excuses?
TROY
Pops my course load is full anyway.
I’m head of Econ Board, I’m
thinking about Pastiche.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Pastiche? On Kurt Fletcher’s staff?
TROY
You know to round out the res?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll be God damned if twenty years
from now you have to end up working
for that dumb asses son.
TROY
(put in his place)
Yes sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Fletcher and I graduated a year
apart. He barely made it through. I
graduated Summa cum Laude. Now look
who’s President and who’s Dean.
TROY
What’s the difference?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
A couple hundred grand a year.
Understand what I’m saying? Now
what happened between you and Sam
to make her come after you anyway?
TROY
Sofia. You remember Sofia? Daughter
of the President. Psych major. “Has
the world ahead of her Troy.”
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t like your tone boy.
TROY
Sorry sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
So you lost the House. On to the
school presidency then.
The light in Troy’s eyes dims a bit.
39.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
It’ll be good to show this campus
is capable of electing someone like
you as school president.
TROY
Someone like me?
33 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 33
Troy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower
runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet
apparatus. He jots down on a notepad and LAUGHS to himself.
TROY’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME
Sofia has her face to the floor - peering underneath the
bathroom door. She can see Troy’s feet. What the hell?
Off the SQUEAK of the shower being cut Sofia jumps up.
MOMENTS LATER
Troy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. Sofia on the
couch pretends to have been watching television.
TROY
Babe. Hat or no hat?
Troy stands before her in his undies holding a Kangol. He
eyes her oversized T-shirt.
TROY (CONT’D)
Are you wearing that?
SOFIA
I don’t have to be.
Sofia yanks Troy to her by his underwear to kiss his navel.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
Hey boo...why don’t we put some of
your new found free time to good
use? It’s been a while since...
TROY
What’s with all this boo stuff?
SOFIA
...since you fucked me with your
big Black cock.
Troy pulls away.
40.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
It used to turn you on when I
talked like that. Is it me?
TROY
(yes)
I love you.
SOFIA
Is it Sam?
TROY
Can we please just, get ready?
SOFIA
Why? I hate my brother’s friends.
Troy thinks over his next words carefully.
TROY
You’re not going to go with me?
SOFIA
You’d go without me?
Troy tries to flash a charming shrug.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
You’re my guest!
Sofia gathers some books and heads for the door.
TROY
You can hang out while I’m --
SOFIA
-- Okay, what’s with you and my
brother? Are you in love with him?
Is this like, some DL shit?
Sofia storms out.
TROY
“DL shit!?”
34 INT. FOREST - NIGHT 34
Lionel walks up the darkly lit stairs of a very old building.
He reaches a door marked “Newsroom.”
35 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 35
Lionel looks around the dimmed office. There is music and
light coming from a room past all the cubicles...
41.
36 INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 36
...An office filled with computers. George and a few other
EDITORS scream with laughter - beers and pizza in hand.
GEORGE does a beat on his desk while...
GEORGE
I keeps it clean
Ya know what I mean.
I drinks my Vodka straight,
like I’m a fiend.
ANNIE, a strawberry blonde laughs in George’s lap. Lionel’s
envy shows.
ANNIE
Wait, quiet I want to hear this.
Annie turns up a Youtube video of...
COCO (O.S.)
If I could grow straight Indian
hair out my head --
ANNIE
Ohmigod, this is going on Facebook.
Annie swivels in her chair only to SCREAM BLOODY MURDER at
the sight of Lionel.
LIONEL
Relax the Negro at the door is not
here to rape you.
Annie laughs. The mood is drunk and light.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
So this is what editors do?
GEORGE
We’re taking a break, what are you
doing here?
LIONEL
You wanted me to drop in and tell
you how the story was coming?
GEORGE
Yeah like this week. It’s Saturday
night. You got nowhere else to be?
LIONEL
It was this or the new Madea movie.
42.
GEORGE
Dear God. Where does Madea go this
time? Dialysis?
37 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 37
Sam, flanked by Reggie and the BoFros are in mid rant.
REGGIE
Man fuck Tyler Perry.
SAM
Like, can we have a movie with, you
know characters in them? ‘Stead of
stereotypes wrapped in Christian
dogma?
REGGIE
Why is every educated person
inherently evil? Why this Nigga
gotta be in a mutha fucking dress
all the mutha fucking time?
SAM
How come the only Black movies
Hollywood wants to make are ones
with mammies in fat suits or Black
women in pain man?
All of this is directed at a TEENAGER in the box office.
TEENAGER
Most people are here to see Fang 9.
(after a beat)
Kelly Rowland’s in it?
The group throw up their hands and groan in protest.
38 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 38
Game Night and Kurt’s house is filled with smoke, music, and
rich kids who play cards at various tables.
Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. A
few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. This
perks her up, as she arches her back slightly...
...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER
GIRL who has entered behind her.
Coco catches herself in the mirror. What don’t they see?
38A CARD TABLE 38A
43.
Troy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy
holds court - much to Kurt’s chagrin. The mood is playful.
There’s a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco.
39 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
A huge “Boycott Sal’s Pizzeria” poster hangs on the walls of
Sam’s chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros
and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about.
Underground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint
coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on “SCHOOL DAZE” which
plays on her 36’ flatscreen.
SAM
How ‘bout you stop stereotyping
yourself and put that shit out?
This ain’t “Friday.”
REGGIE
Yo Sam. We got to talk about the
protest. When are we are bringing
the Housing fight to the prez?
Sungmi takes a seat next to Sam. Some kids hop up and start
grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist.
SUNGMI
The House voted down sponsoring the
rally.
REGGIE
What do we need it sponsored for?
SAM
Demonstrations can get shut down if
a House doesn’t sponsor them.
REGGIE
Like the House you’re head of?
Sam shoots Reggie a glare. He backs off.
SUNGMI
Hey Sam, I read “Ebony and Ivy.”
What’s with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs,
One Hundred stuff? I miss
something?
Sam smiles.
SAM
You want me to break it down?
44.
40 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 40
Troy deals another hand with Kurt, Mitch and Gordon. Troy’s
homeboy swag is thicker than usual.
MITCH
Yo my perfect Friday night is
whiskey and my T-Bone Walker
records, real talk.
TROY
Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker?
40A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 40A
SAM
Only a few ways colored folks
survive at a place like this.
MITCH
Uh only a pioneer of electric and
jump blues bro. Know your roots.
TROY
White folks always be on stuff like
decades too late and act like they
discovered some shit.
SAM
“Oofta” is the jazz age term for
Bojangle types who Blacked it up
for White audiences.
MITCH
Don’t sleep on T-Bone man.
TROY
Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu
got on right now?
MITCH
Public Enemy my Nig--
TROY
--Yo watch that man.
GORDON
You just called him --
TROY
-- Ya’ll get Country Clubs we get
to say Nigga.
Everyone at the table erupts in laughter. Except Kurt.
45.
GORDON
And golf? And all our girls?
TROY
Whatchu mean all your girls?
GORDON
Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley
Snipes and uh, Troy over here...
TROY
Yo. It’s a word for that.
Reparations.
More Kurt-less laughter from the table.
TROY (CONT’D)
Forty white bitches and a mule.
Perfectly executed. Troy grins as the table erupts.
SAM
An Oofta modulates his Blackness up
or down depending on the crowd and
what he wants from them.
MITCH
Kurt?
KURT
What?
GORDON
Kurt.
Troy watches this exchange closely.
GORDON (CONT’D)
Troy. You thinking about Pastiche?
TROY
That’s the magazine right?
GORDON
For starters.
MITCH
What other “magazine” you know has
a first look deal at NBC? The third
biggest Youtube channel. Talk show.
Platinum comedy record homie!
46.
GORDON
Couldn’t you see him on the talk
show Kurt?
Kurt looks at his cards.
KURT
I fold.
41 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 41
A small crowd’s formed around Sam.
SUNGMI
Okay, and a nose-job is a wannabe?
42 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 42
Coco finishes her drink and catches Mitch and Gordon as they
start up a Youtube video on their iPad. The previous game is
over. They watch “Dear White People - 1,378,480 views.”
42A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 42A
SAM
Sort of. Nose-jobs smooth their
Black edges and try to blend.
Coco runs her fingers through her straight hair.
GORDON
You seen this one?
SAM (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People using Instagram.
You have an iPhone and go on hikes.
I get it.
COCO
Ugh.
Gordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco. Mitch eyes her curves.
GORDON
Not a fan?
Coco makes a “no” face.
MITCH
Sup ma?
COCO
Don’t talk like that.
47.
GORDON
Hey I know you...
Coco is taken aback as Gordon punches up her video and plays
it back. She hovers over them.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
Coco a bit embarrassed scans the view count.
SAM
A Nose-job’s worst fear is that
their “Blackness” might cause a
fuss or draw undue attention so
they apologize for it or use it to
self deprecate.
COCO
Forty thousand views already?
GORDON
Looks like someone submitted you to
Buzzfeed. Taking off...
Coco leans over them and scrolls down. The first comment is
from a HELMUT: “Much better...” Coco soaks this in.
MITCH
You wan’ a drink a sun’in?
COCO
Let me guess you’re from Ohio?
MITCH
Vermont.
GORDON
What do you have against Dear White
People?
Coco smiles and slyly clicks to her next video.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People. How do I feel
about it? Well for one it’s Blacker
than thou propaganda from a bougie
Lisa Bonet wannabe who smells like
patchouli and frankly I can’t
believe we’re letting Sam get away
with it.
48.
Mitch and Gordon’s mouths are ajar. Coco studies the view
count...26,758. A pride strikes Coco.
43 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 43
As the impromptu party dies down...
SUNGMI
Okay and One Hundred?
REGGIE
Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black
as hell just cause.
Sam rolls her eyes.
SUNGMI
But what about just being you?
SAM
Like I said...
44 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 44
Lionel’s got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie’s really
warmed to him - her hands play with his afro.
ANNIE
You don’t mind do you?
SAM (V.O.)
There’s only a few ways a person of
a color can survive at a place like
this...
LIONEL
Of course not.
GEORGE
Alright so then what?
LIONEL
So then Sam says “What, is your
daddy scared the Negroes are gonna
start a rebellion on the
plantation?”
George goes CRAZY at this.
GEORGE
To Kurt Fletcher!?
LIONEL
Yeah. Yes. Yup.
49.
GEORGE
We’ve got a news item but there’s
something bigger here. It’s a
profile piece on Armstrong / Parker
and Sam White’s pseudo revolution.
ANNIE
What’s the headline?
LIONEL
Outdated nationalist seeks purpose
starts race war?
Lionel’s joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it.
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES
before Lionel briefly.
GEORGE
Beers in the corner. Bang out the
news item tonight and we’ll work on
the profile piece for next week.
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open
computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and
Annie stare at Lionel expectantly.
LIONEL
What are you doing?
ANNIE
All Bugle staffer must freestyle.
It’s law.
GEORGE
You want to be a staffer right?
LIONEL
(awkward)
My name is Lionel
Kind of like a lion
King of the jungle
Indigenous to Africa...
The beat has long since stopped.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Sorry.
45 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 45
Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out.
50.
TROY
Yo man, you know I wasn’t talking
about Sof back there with whole
forty bitches thing. I was just --
KURT
-- trying to get on my staff?
TROY
I never really thought about --
KURT
-- Bullshit. Game Night is where we
make our bids for the new staff.
It’s why everyone’s here. You were
practically about to bust out a tap
dance.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man. I just
came to hang out.
KURT
My staff likes you. A lot.
TROY
But you don’t.
KURT
This thing with you and Sof...
TROY
I’m good to her.
KURT
Our dad’s have been playing a game
of chess off and on since 1972.
TROY
What and Sof is the White queen?
KURT
You’re a pawn. And I think it’s
time you get off the board bro.
Troy takes this in.
KURT (CONT’D)
Here’s the deal. Every year we
throw a party. The point is to mock
the self important and moronic
entities of the campus. The way to
get staffed is to write an invite
for the party.
51.
(MORE)
Our invites are legendary, we make
Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs
every year. If your invite is the
one that goes out, you’re
guaranteed a spot on the staff. The
runners up are voted on by the rest
of us.
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance.
45A LIVING ROOM 45A
Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. She’s in her
element with these boys at her feet.
COCO
I just think having good hair and
carrying on with a degree of
sophistication doesn’t make me a
traitor to the race.
MITCH
Want to know why they used to call
me Black Mitch?
GORDON
Absolutely not.
COCO
No one called you that.
KITCHEN
Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach...
TROY
Okay. And what’s this year’s theme?
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively.
KURT
Still working on that...
TROY
The party’s a couple weeks away.
GORDON
Yo Kurt. I want you to meet
someone.
COCO
You guys got a party coming up?
Coco smiles at Kurt, before flicking her eyes over Troy.
52.
KURT (CONT’D)
46 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 46
Sungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam’s apartment as
the party winds down.
SUNGMI
Hey, about the rally. You could
still get the permit anyway Sam and
go against the board. Most people
consider that political suicide
though.
REGGIE
We got to rally Sam. Time is now.
SAM
Use your head Reggie. You think a
rally is going to change things?
REGGIE
It’ll do a hell of a lot more than
a radio show or views on Youtube.
Everyone gets quiet. Sungmi takes this time to exit.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Look, we got power Sam and it’s
time we used it. We earned it.
SAM
We? I didn’t see you running for
shit Reggie.
The Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. Sam waits a beat
and rolls her eyes.
47 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT 47
Sam walks after Reggie.
REGGIE
Tired.
SAM
Don’t “one word” me.
REGGIE
Why you got to snap at me all the
time? I’m around you like twenty
four seven. Like your lap dog. I
don’t even usually get down like
that with no red bone chicks man.
53.
SAM
Don’t call me that.
REGGIE
Come on, I thought your ass was
Puerto Rican when I met you.
Sam turns to go.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Oh so you can dish it out but you
can’t take it?
SAM
I’m taking my ass home.
REGGIE
Come on Sam. You know how I feel
about you.
SAM
How am I supposed to know how you
feel about me?
REGGIE
You know what? Forgive me if I see
something in you. Something
inspiring. Something folks like me
can get behind.
Reggie puts his hands on Sam’s belt and pulls her in to a
kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie’s shoulder Sam sees...
...Gabe look back at her. He’s heartbroken. She pretends not
to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Tell me you’ll set up the rally.
SAM
I’ll set up the rally.
48 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 48
Kurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances.
GORDON
Are we sure about this?
KURT
It’s ironic. Bold. And don’t tell
me I’m the only one who thinks Sam
White’s little movement needs to
get cut down to size.
54.
Agreement Coco’s gaze. Uncertainty in Troy’s.
KURT (CONT’D)
Looks like you got your Hip Hop
party Mitch.
MITCH
‘Bout time. It’s going to be huge
man, fucking epic.
Kurt holds back a smile.
KURT
Boys, we’ve got a lot more mingling
to do. We’ll be in touch. And Troy?
Get off the board bro.
Troy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. Troy smiles,
goes to exit.
TROY
Nice seeing you.
COCO
Where’s Sofia?
TROY
I have no idea.
COCO
Trouble in paradise?
Troy shrugs and heads to the party.
COCO (CONT’D)
Figures.
(off Troy’s
incredulousness)
Nothing. I’m sure you’ve got
something else fair and petite
and...fair lined up for that drink.
TROY
What’s that supposed to mean?
COCO
It’s fine. I’m not even really into
Black dudes anyway.
TROY
I’ll have you know I’m an equal
opportunity employer, okay?
55.
COCO
And what kind of jobs are you
hiring for mister?
Coco’s stiletto rubs the side of Troy’s calf.
TROY
Aren’t you and Sofia --
COCO
-- I’m an accessory to Sofia. Can’t
ever shake the feeling I’m an
assignment for that Afro Studies
Minor of hers.
Troy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards
this dangerous and tempting creature before him.
COCO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you have no idea what I
mean.
49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49
Lionel and George walk through the campus at night. George
waves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House.
LIONEL
She seems really cool.
George just smiles.
GEORGE
Did we go too far? You’re in
Armstrong/Parker right?
LIONEL
No. Garmin.
GEORGE
Fancy.
LIONEL
George I’m not exactly down with
Sam and I’m not in the BSU. I got
kicked out of Armstrong / Parker
same as Kurt. But I’m going to
write a good story, okay?
GEORGE
I hope so. I want a Bugle on your
chest by the end of the month.
Lionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest.
56.
They reach the front of Lionel’s house. George runs his hand
through Lionel’s hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some
other kids - trade glances.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Your fro’s so gnarly.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
GEORGE
Night Lionel.
Lionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of
Mitch and company.
MITCH
Party’s not over.
LIONEL
I live here.
MITCH
Sorry bro. Invitation only.
LIONEL
It’s two in the morning.
Mitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.
Lionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He
scrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.
Starts an email.
50 INT. TROY’S BEDROOM - MORNING 50
Troy’s Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and
besides a bright pink thong.
Coco’s pink painted finger nails travel through the creases
of Troy’s immaculate abs.
TROY
Coco huh?
COCO
Colandrea doesn’t exactly pass the
resume test, you know? I mean
couldn’t you fucking die? My
parents should’ve just named me
Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do
you...indulge?
Coco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.
57.
TROY
It’s ten am.
Coco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
I don’t mess with that stuff.
Coco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.
COCO
Sure about that?
TROY
Sure you don’t like Black guys?
COCO
Girl like me is just a placeholder
for ya’ll at a place like this.
TROY
I’m not like that.
COCO
I don’t think Sam would agree.
TROY
That was different.
COCO
No it wasn’t. Poor thing, she was
light skin-ded and everything.
TROY
Yo, it wasn’t like that alright?
Troy’s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy’s.
TROY (CONT’D)
My pops. He wanted me with
Fletcher’s daughter. They’ve been
in competition ever since they went
here. Pops hates that Fletcher
ended up President and he got stuck
as the Dean.
COCO
So your upbringing may have
actually fucked you up more than
mine? That’s hot.
Troy laughs and takes the joint back.
58.
COCO (CONT’D)
The hell is the difference between
a Dean and a President anyway?
TROY
Apparently four hundred years of
unreconciled oppression.
COCO
He’s not going to like you running
with the Pastiche boys is he?
TROY
If I even get tapped.
COCO
You will. And you should do it.
They all land somewhere big, some
before they even graduate. I’ve
seen you in front of a crowd Troy.
I bet you could be famous.
TROY
That what you want? To be famous?
COCO
I want people to know my name.
TROY
Which one?
Coco’s phone buzzes with a message. It’s Kurt.
COCO
(reading)
We want you. Come by Ellington
tomorrow at eight.
(to Troy)
Anything?
Troy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy’s
eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.
COCO (CONT’D)
You’re going to have to stand up to
him sooner or later Troy.
52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52
Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation
marks her pretty face.
SOFIA
You said you loved me.
59.
TROY
I like you a lot.
Salt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.
SOFIA
What do you do in the bathroom?
When you leave the shower running?
Was it just to get away from me?
Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess.
TROY
I smoke weed and write jokes.
Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...
...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
Troy turns to enter the house.
53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53
Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other’s gaze.
As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
they’re headed in the same direction.
53A UPSTAIRS 53A
Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
with a key. Troy’s already at the door when he looks up and
realizes Lionel’s just entered his apartment.
54 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54
TROY
The hell are you doing?
LIONEL & TROY
This is my apartment.
TROY
The hell it is.
LIONEL
The Dean said it was the only
opening.
TROY
Head of House doesn’t share.
60.
LIONEL
But you’re not Head of House.
Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
leaving Lionel alone in the living room.
57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57
Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.
DREADS
Stay Black, my brother.
LIONEL
Sure thing?
Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
entrance - suddenly chums. Troy’s getting good news and
gladly shakes Kurt’s hand.
KURT
Need your submission by Thursday.
TROY
You got it bro.
The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.
KURT
The fuck?
Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.
TROY
Yo!
Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.
Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
briefly who shares the same smirk.
He realizes Sam’s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.
REGGIE
Finally made it in.
61.
DREADS
Been moved around a lot right?
CURLS
You must have been terrified when
you saw “Armstrong/Parker” written
on your moving assignment.
LIONEL
I was just finishing up.
REGGIE
Do Black people scare you?
LIONEL
(realizing its true)
No.
REGGIE
You’re too scared to even ask
anyone for a cut.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
DREADS
No. I’m growing it out. You’re
fostering an ecosystem.
REGGIE
How come you don’t come to BSU?
LIONEL
I listen to Mumford and Sons and
watch Robert Altman movies. You
honestly think I’m Black enough for
the union?
DREADS
Yo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha
fucka goes in.
CURLS
(after a beat)
We’re not all homophobes you know.
Black folks?
Lionel’s eyes dart around. How did she know?
DREADS
I’m bumping Frank Ocean right now.
I don’t give a fuck. Imma still eat
at Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets
good as hell.
62.
LIONEL
I’m late for class.
REGGIE
You’re the “Black voice” of the
Bugle now. We’re just trying to
decide if you are friend or foe.
Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.
Sam’s on the front page with the headline “WHITE STUDENTS
TOLD TO ‘GET OUT’ BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
REGGIE (CONT’D)
We got to protect our girl.
Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over
something with Martin at another table.
LIONEL
I’m not on staff. Not until I make
good on my assignment, I’m just --
REGGIE
-- Assignment? What’s the story?
LIONEL
They want me to do a profile piece
on Black culture at Manchester.
REGGIE
Of which you are so clearly an
expert.
Shame floods Lionel’s face.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
So what’s harder man? Being Black
enough for the Black kids or the
white ones?
LIONEL
Being neither.
Another GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This
time it’s for...
...Gabe, who’s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...
GABE
Sam! Really Sam?
She just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.
63.
58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58
Professor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students
fill in essay questions. Sam’s eyes are glued to a window...
Outside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and
start pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.
Sam’s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch
the time.
59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A
Sam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.
From behind her...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Running late.
Sam pauses and turns to see him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
For your little rally?
SAM
Forget your sign Dean?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you honestly think this is in
the spirit of Armstrong / Parker
house?
SAM
The role of the counter culture is
to wake up the mainstream to --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- I’ve got furniture older than
you. Counter culture? Is that what
you think this is? That show of
yours?
SAM
What about my show?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your show is racist.
SAM
Black people can’t be racist.
The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.
64.
SAM (CONT’D)
Prejudice? Yes. But not racist.
Racism describes a system of
disadvantage based on race. Black
people can’t be racist since they
don’t benefit from such a system.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you read the school papers?
SAM
Is the New York Times a school
paper?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your antics are making press Sam
and press like this keeps men like
President Fletcher up at night.
SAM
Warm milk?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
He’s building a file on you.
SAM
It’s not my fault your son couldn’t
beat me in an election.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sure it was hard growing up.
Wondering which side you fit into.
Feeling like you have to
overcompensate perhaps?
SAM
If that’s true, I’m not the only
one Dean.
Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank’s last words resonate
more than she’d like.
Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.
59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B
Huge canvas signs with the words “WHITES ONLY” are strewn
about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.
Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the
SUV.
65.
REGGIE
There you are! We supposed to start
at noon.
SAM
I told you I had class.
There’s a vibration in Sam’s pocket. Her phone says “MOM.”
She cuts it off and picks up a “white’s only” sign.
REGGIE
Those are going up on Gillespie.
Good right?
Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it’s too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Yo. What’s that? You’re not getting
cold feet are you?
SAM
No. I mean how long do I have to
talk anyway?
REGGIE
You’re kidding right? You’re sort
of the keynote.
SAM
Yeah but...you know I think the
whole Malcolm X thing is your lane
Reg. I’m just not --
REGGIE
-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab
a bullhorn. Turn it on.
Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: “IT’S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME”
Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who’s just happened upon the parking lot.
GABE
What is all this?
SAM
(on phone)
Hey. In the middle of--
-- Okay. Okay. Okay.
66.
Tears well up in Sam’s eyes as she shakes her head no and
heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.
When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
look of indignation asks her what she’s doing.
REGGIE
Sam?
Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie’s
heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Sam!
60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60
Reggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam’s door.
REGGIE
Yo, what the hell Sam?
61 INT. SAM’S ROOM - DAY 61
The banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The
tears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.
GABE
You want me to tell them to go?
SAM
You’re so tough.
GABE
I will.
SAM
I want you to wait until they’ve
gone and then head home.
GABE
I’m trying to be here for you.
SAM
Can you be somewhere else for me?
61A HALLWAY 61A
REGGIE
Sam! I know you’re home.
67.
61B SAM’S ROOM 61B
GABE
What do you see in him?
SAM
The only eligible single brother on
campus.
GABE
Wow. Okay.
SAM
I get it. Your parents owned in
Harlem or something? You watched
“Do The Right Thing” in high school
and you want to prove to the world
you’re down?
GABE
I want to be down? How long does it
take to get your hair like that?
REGGIE (O.S.)
Sam. We want to talk.
SAM
Reggie I will call you later damn!
(to Gabe)
You don’t know what you’re talking
about. Girls like me--
GABE
--what? Have to pick a side? I’m
sick of your tragic Mulatto
bullshit Sam!
SAM
You can’t say Mulatto.
GABE
Mulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!
MORE BANGING
SAM
Window. Go out the window.
GABE
I’m sorry if I can’t be your Nubian
prince on my Black horse ready to
take you back to fucking Zamunda!
68.
SAM
That’s not a real African country.
GABE
Can I please get some credit for a
solid “Coming to America”
reference?
Sam tries not laugh at this.
GABE (CONT’D)
This isn’t you Sam.
SAM
No? And who am I?
GABE
You’re this...girl...
SAM
Perceptive.
GABE
Who...likes to argue with me about
every fucking thing. And I hate it
because we both know you’re smarter
than me. Your favorite director is
Bergman, but you tell people its
Spike Lee. You love bebop, but
you’ve got a thing for Taylor
Swift. I know because my Mac picks
up your Mac’s library.
SAM
And I was so careful...
GABE
You like to use phrases from the
thirties and wear clothes from the
fifties and hairstyles from the
sixties. You like to watch me when
you think I’m sleeping. And trace
the outlines of my face.
Sam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.
GABE (CONT’D)
You’re more “Banksy” than “Barack”
but you’ve been co-opted as some
sort of revolutionary leader or
something? But really you’re an
anarchist. A beautiful writer,
artist, filmmaker, shit starter.
And beautiful, in general.
69.
Sam’s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: “Mom.”
SAM
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. It’s okay. Get
some sleep.
Sam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE
from Sam as she let’s go of the tension she’d been holding.
GABE
Everything okay?
SAM
(happy tears)
His condition’s stable.
GABE
Good. That’s good Sam.
Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.
SAM
Gabe!
Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...
GABE
What!?
...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down
the heartbroken looks on her disciples’ faces.
SAM
I’m sorry.
And with that she closes the door right on Reggie.
62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62
Coco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing
terrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee’s.
HELMUT
New videos are picking up steam.
COCO
Told you I was good TV.
HELMUT
The show I’m scouting for... It’s
called Black Face / White Place.
It’s reality. Like a “True Life.”
Each episode centers on a different
one of “us” in a sea of “them.”
70.
COCO
Interesting.
HELMUT
Interesting? You think they want
interesting? Dignified stories of
triumph and survival?
(off Coco’s naive shrug)
They want the “authentic urban
experience” which is basically
network talk for bitching and weave
snatching. I’m telling you this
because the network is looking to
take one of the subjects to series.
I got one episode. One shot to find
that subject. So if we do this...
COCO
...we do it all the way. I’m
guessing Sam turned you down.
HELMUT
I think so. She called me a
Bojangling Oofta, whatever that
means. Everything else she said
would’ve been bleeped on tv.
(off Coco’s laugh)
So look, forty thousand hits on
Youtube is good. It’s not great.
COCO
I’m about to get a whole lot more.
63 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - DAY 63
Coco sits before a video camera. The room is dim.
KURT
We don’t have anyone like you on
staff and you had a great idea. We
brought you here to --
COCO
-- I want to MC it. Your party.
KURT
We’re here to tell you what we
want.
COCO
You want me and in order to get me,
you have to let me MC.
71.
(MORE)
And I want to do a live video blog
from my Youtube account.
BACK TO:
64 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 64
HELMUT
They’d let you do that?
COCO
They got no choice. They need me --
BACK TO:
65 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65
COCO
-- cause without me ya’ll look like
a bunch of privileged assholes.
KURT
We don’t let people video blog our
events...
COCO
...You got a week to put this thing
together boo boo. What’s it going
to be?
CUT TO:
66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66
Helmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye.
COCO
You look surprised.
HELMUT
It’s just...
67 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67
Troy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in
their rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. They
each look at the other in alternate intervals.
HELMUT (V.O.)
...not everyone is as camera ready
as you.
67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A
72.
COCO (CONT'D)
Lionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on
his TV and heads to...
67B KITCHEN 67B
...bar divide. Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy’s
room. He’s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels
Lionel’s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.
67C TROY’S ROOM 67C
Troy types in “KURT FLETCHER” in the “To” field and “PASTICHE
SUBMISSION” in the subject field. He hits “send” and swallows
the lump in his throat.
68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68
Troy gingerly enters into the Dean’s office. Martin and Dean
Fairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, would you share with Troy
what you shared with me?
MARTIN
The server that processes the
voting results for House Elections
has shut down the A.P. database.
Saw it this morning. Apparently the
intermediary program is on a
refractile loop.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man.
MARTIN
Sam currently has 445 votes. That’s
200 more than she had last week
during the actual election.
TROY
There’s not even that many
residents in Armstrong / Parker.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
She cheated. Hacked the system.
69 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY 69
Sam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the
Dean’s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.
73.
SAM
I wouldn’t even begin to know how
to do something like that.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Is your little war really this
important?
Sam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
I understand the pressure to stand
for something at an institution
like this but you’re barking up the
wrong tree okay?
70 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70
MARTIN
Had to have been Reggie. Dude’s in
my programing class. Good. Just
forgot to turn his program off.
TROY
Wow.
MARTIN
You’re the rightful Head of House.
TROY
(shit)
So great.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, let me talk to Troy for a
bit. I appreciate this.
71 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71
Sam glares at Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Your advisor tells me you’re
hanging on by a thread in you
major. Perhaps it’s time to
reprioritize.
SAM
You’re trying to frighten me, but I
think you’re the one who’s scared.
74.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
And I think you long for the days
where Blacks were hanging from
trees and denied actual rights.
Then you’d actually have something
to fight against.
A swell of emotion behind Sam’s steel eyes.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
You will be facing two hearings in
the coming weeks that could end in
either Probation or Suspension. One
on the merits of your show, the
other on your election to Head of
House.
Sam is truly scared by this.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Your responsibilities to your house
are suspended. Your show is done
for. And another one of your
illegal “demonstrations” will only
make matters worse. This is a
critical time for this school.
SAM
You damn right it is.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
We don’t have an intolerance
problem here. Except for the one
I’m looking at.
72 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 72
Troy and his father are alone.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You didn’t tell me you and Sofia
had a misunderstanding.
TROY
Who did?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Her father. She was very upset.
(off Troy’s silence)
Troy. What sort of vision do you
have for yourself?
75.
TROY
Get my degree. Then Law School and
then --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
--And what’s that got to do with
partying with Kurt? With smoking
weed and writing jokes?
Panic flashes over Troy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight
Kurt gets? You want to be on...tv
or something? You know how many
Black men waste their lives to get
on TV? Be rappers and ball players?
TROY
(wanting it to be true)
Dad no. I want what we always
talked about. Maybe have my own
firm someday? Run for office. Make
a difference. Wife. Kids. I want
all that. I really really do.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And the drugs? God damn it Troy I
taught you better than this. I have
been in academia a long time, I’ve
seen a lot of things. The men who
really run this world? You got no
idea what they see when they see
you. You are not going to be what
they all think you are. You will
not give them that satisfaction,
you hear me?
TROY
Yes sir.
73 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73
Sam steps out of Fletcher’s office into the waiting room.
Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other
down as Kurt enters his father’s office.
A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit
the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through
the window.
Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and
listens in.
76.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
I know about the party. You picked
a hell of a time.
KURT
What party --
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
-- You’re cancelling Kurt. End of
story.
75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75
Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
hears...
GEORGE (O.S.)
Lionel’s story on the would-be
protest outside of Gillespie is
running tomorrow and I’m also
having Lionel work on a profile
piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
suggested. Really break down what’s
going on.
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
phone call.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Right. It’s almost like they
recycle so much from their past -
Music, food, fashion, and now
turbulence.
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel’s mouth.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Thank you so much. Okay, take care.
George can’t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.
ANNIE
Well?
GEORGE
That was our Times advisor. He said
it’s stories like these that get
editors recommendation letters.
Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
reassured when they see who it is.
77.
LIONEL
The Negro at the door didn’t scare
you this time.
Annie smiles and heads for the door.
ANNIE
Lionel please. You’re only
technically Black. G, going to
French. You want me to hold your
seat?
GEORGE
Thanks.
Annie smiles and walks out.
LIONEL
You need something? Saw your email.
GEORGE
Yeah, I need someone to do the
Donor’s function on Saturday. Small
dinner for the school’s big givers.
Administration wants a little
coverage.
LIONEL
That’s Halloween night.
GEORGE
Right, which is why no one else
will take it.
LIONEL
Ah. Thus the new guy.
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.
GEORGE
On my way to class, but you can
stay and check out last year’s
piece. You’ll do fine.
LIONEL
I don’t know. Are there going to be
any racially fueled outbursts at
this thing?
GEORGE
Never know right?
78.
It’s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.
LIONEL
Am I a good writer?
GEORGE
You’ll get better. And we need you
right now.
LIONEL
You’re just a big recommendation
away from landing the Times.
GEORGE
God I hope so.
Lionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Hey.
-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So
instead he just kisses him.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I’m glad we finally got that Bugle
on your chest.
Lionel’s all mixed up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
There’s a big party the night of
the Donor’s event. Call me after,
maybe we can hang?
LIONEL
Yeah. Sounds good.
George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed.
76 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76
Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag
to reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He’s getting
ready for something.
His phone buzzes with a notification: “Message from:
PASTICHE”
Troy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...
79.
KURT (V.O.)
Dear White People. Are you tired of
your hum drum, Wonderbread
existence of accidental racism and
wishing you could sip on Henny out
yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving
you the side-eye? Course you are.
MONTAGE:
As our subjects get ready for their evening.
Troy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and
correcting imperceptible imperfections.
KURT (V.O.)
For all those looking to unleash
their inner Negro from years of
bondage and oppression Pastiche
proudly presents “Dear White
People” our 89th annual Hallow’s
Eve Costume Party - tonight at 10
Pacific Time or 5 Colored People
Time. Sorry for the short notice,
but let’s keep it one hun-ed.
You’ve had us on your calendar for
weeks.
76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A
combing out his unwieldy fro. He flinches in pain as he
fluffs out each section.
KURT (V.O.)
Dudes must rock FUBU, Ecko,
Rocawear, or Sean John. XXXL is the
smallest size T-Shirt you can wear,
preferably with a collage of Barack
Obama and Tupac on it. Stunner
Shades, chains, and Blue-Tooth
devices sticking out yo ears are
also encouraged.
76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B
smooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with
foundation. She begins on her eyes.
KURT (V.O.)
Ladies, we need to see huge hoop
earrings, long nails, and cheap
tight clothes.
80.
(MORE)
A proper hood rat starts fights,
speaks loudly, and when she can’t
think of the word she’s trying to
say just makes one up, such as
“edumicated.” Feel free to fry up
some chicken, bring Kool-Aid,
Watermelon, 40s, Henny, and of
course Dat Purple Drank. No bougie
bitches allowed.
76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C
up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around
her ears. She takes in her image in the mirror.
KURT (V.O.)
Naturally there will be a freestyle
rap competition so bring it, get yo
shine on and join us for the party
of the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga. Boy that felt good.
77 EXT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 77
Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside
while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the
entrance. He smokes on Coco’s one-hitter from before.
Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.
The two are surprised to see each other.
LIONEL
Funny seeing you here.
TROY
Father likes to show me off at all
the Donor functions. The dessert
course is usually my cue to take a
breather while they talk shop.
(friendlier)
The trick is to dazzle them into
forking over their estates just
before they kick the bucket.
Lionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.
LIONEL
So...Picard or Kirk?
TROY
Kirk. Wait...
LIONEL
I saw you watching Star --
81.
KURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
TROY
-- Yo what happens in the crib
stays in the crib. Not trying to
get my card revoked.
LIONEL
Hey, some could argue that a show
with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn
and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty
Black show.
TROY
Yeah? That work out for you?
LIONEL
No. No it did not. At least not in
High School. I bet there’s a statue
of you at your High School.
TROY
I was beloved. Won’t lie.
LIONEL
Did they know you were a trekker?
TROY
My pops left a paint by numbers
template for success at that High
School. All I had to do was fill in
the blanks. Football captain.
Valedictorian. Prom King.
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
So what? You’re growing that out?
LIONEL
I think it’s gaining sentience.
TROY
It’s...out there.
LIONEL
It’s like a black hole for white
people’s fingers. They’re obsessed.
TROY
You know I cut hair. Why didn’t you
ask me?
LIONEL
You’re I dunno...you?
82.
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to
Gillespie.
GEORGE
Li! You ready man?
LIONEL
No costumes? I got a tux for this.
ANNIE
We just got out of the staff room.
GEORGE
Yeah, we’re going as overworked.
LIONEL
Where is it?
ANNIE
Garmin House. On third I think?
LIONEL
Third and Basin. I know it.
Before Lionel jets to join them.
TROY
Yo man. If I’d gone to your High
School, I’d have had your back.
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends.
78 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 78
Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos
of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.
79 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 79
The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.
It’s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
“Purple Drank.” Everyone downs the stuff.
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT
Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.
TROY
...my own firm. Maybe run for
office. Make a difference you know?
83.
The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy’s eyes to his phone -
photos from “Dear White People” pop up in his news feed.
80 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 80
Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously
put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
glances at the posters - it’s Kurt with a large Afro wig
mimicking Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyers.
LIONEL
This is kind of fucked up. Right?
GEORGE
Pastiche. The world’s most erudite
boneheads. Who wants another round?
Come on Lionel, help a brother out.
LIONEL
Kitchen’s this way.
80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A
Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She’s
feeling herself as she’s handed a drink.
She’s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.
Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...
COCO
Hey there muffins. How do I look?
Why are white folks so obsessed
with being Black? And why are Black
folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
doll weaves? Honeys it’s a strange
symbiosis we’re here to explore...
Coco’s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her
iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.
80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B
Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the
kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...
80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C
...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales
Lionel’s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel’s hair.
84.
LIONEL
Ouch.
GEORGE
Sorry.
LIONEL
It’s okay. Can’t wait to cut all
this off.
GEORGE
Don’t you dare.
George plunges his fingers into Lionel’s fro once again.
Pulls a touch too hard.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I could eat you like a Hershey’s.
This sets something off in Lionel.
LIONEL
I’ll be right back.
Lionel breaks George’s grasp and heads out the bathroom...
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
...and back out into the party. He’s trapped in a nightmare
of caricatures and reveling students. Can’t breathe.
EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
head as he starts walking away from the party.
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.
KURT
What the hell?
81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81
Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the
dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.
DINING HALL
SAM
For a genius dude you’re a fucking
idiot.
85.
REGGIE
I did it, we did it for you.
SAM
I didn’t ask for it Reggie. I look
like I betrayed this house.
REGGIE
Yeah? Well you betrayed me.
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.
LIONEL
Sam? Can we talk?
Sam turns back around fiercely.
82 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 82
A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED
LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.
The crowd starts to get live now.
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She
continues out back...
83 EXT. KURT’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83
...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a
long straight Black wig and brag to friends...
ANNIE
Hey who am I? “Bitch it’s weave.
Noun. Present tense ho!”
Right in the gut. She’s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...
84 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84
Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give
him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the
others. His phone rings.
KURT
Yeah?
INTERCUT
COCO
Kurt, it’s me. I can’t do this.
86.
KURT
Okay, I’m fucking confused.
85 INT. SAM’S ROOM - NIGHT 85
Lionel sits across from Sam.
SAM
What do you want me to do? Go over
there and yell at them?
LIONEL
Have you heard you yelling?
SAM
This house is filled with folks
willing to take up after a cause
Lionel. Believe me. Never would
have guessed you’d be one of them
but...
LIONEL
For the first time in my life, I
can’t just sit around and do
nothing. How can you?
SAM
If I’m caught being a part of
anything like this...it wouldn’t be
good for me right now okay?
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door.
SAM (CONT’D)
I’m done being everybody’s angry
Black chick.
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.
Sam’s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.
86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86
Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining
room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other
students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.
86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A
Lionel gingerly walks in the room. He’s still an outsider
here - but something’s changed in him.
87.
LIONEL
Hey. How’s it going. Hi.
No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Hey...what is this?
SUNGMI
Black Student Union.
Lionel smiles shyly. He should’ve known that.
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.
DREADS
Your call then man.
REGGIE
(to everyone)
Alright ya’ll - thanks for coming
out tonight. Looks like Sam’s not
making it so...let’s just call it.
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...
LIONEL
Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I’m Lionel. Some
of you...none of you probably know
me. I’ve never been to a meeting.
But I just came back from a party
on campus and I think you should
know about it.
Lionel’s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He’s got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Anybody mind if I?
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean...I don’t know. This is
fucked up right?
REGGIE
Alright brother. What’s the plan?
88.
Lionel realizes the eyes aren’t judging. They’re mobilizing.
Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.
LIONEL
We go over there. Now.
CURLS
Think there’s enough of us?
SUNGMI
You know you don’t have a monopoly
on being a pissed off minority.
Latino’s United is meeting across
the hall. Asian American League
too.
(off the stares)
You guys got better snacks.
87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87
Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.
Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to
his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President
Fletcher.
TROY
Dad...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Not now Troy.
TROY
It’s important. There’s something
happening on campus. I might’ve...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’re being rude son.
Dean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--
TROY
Oh am I? How about I tell your
precious donors and anyone here
who’ll listen about the kind of a
school it is they’re giving to?
The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on
him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.
89.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t know who you think you are
young man but you don’t get to talk
to your father any kind of way.
TROY
All I say to you is yes sir and no
sir! Look I should’ve brought this
up before but --
(off Fairbanks dismissal)
-- listen to me!
Dean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.
88 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88
Kurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.
KURT
What?
GORDON
Yeah dude. We all got it. I mean,
everything’s cool right?
A noise in the other room startles them...
88A LIVING ROOM 88A
...It’s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues
with a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid’s face. The
party swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.
A SMASH yanks Kurt’s attention back to the kitchen...
88B KITCHEN 88B
...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.
KURT
Lionel?
Kurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.
KURT (CONT’D)
The fuck you think you’re doing
man?
Lionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids
flood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.
KURT (CONT’D)
That all you got?
90.
LIONEL
We’re putting an end to this Kurt.
KURT
Fuck you I’m calling the cops.
MARTIN
Half of this crowd is under 21.
A loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the
Living Room.
88C LIVING ROOM 88C
Mitch has taken over the mic.
MITCH
Gimme that mic
Before I slap ya
Looking for some dykes,
that wanna another chapta.
If you do me slow,
you can do me faster,
I’ll pass you to the Nigga on my
right, he gets you after.
LIONEL
Kurt--
KURT
-- Why don’t you tuck your tail
between your legs, run and tell the
Dean and get the fuck out.
Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.
Lionel turns to go and spots...
...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
behind George is...
...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.
Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.
Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
one of the rapper’s hands.
LIONEL
Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!
91.
The crowd is with it - thinks it’s part of the show as Lionel
proceeds to freestyle terribly...
LIONEL (CONT’D)
My name is Lionel,
Some people call me Li.
Lots of people think
that I talk kinda white.
Well that’s alright.
Yeah that’s cool.
I’d rather you think I’m white,
than tap dance for you.
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.
Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.
Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel’s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.
Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.
More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.
Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.
Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.
The steel in Sam’s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?
And then she spots...
...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam’s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.
COCO
What? Say it. Come on.
Sam stays silent.
COCO (CONT’D)
This may come as a shock, but these
people don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. They
pay millions of dollars on their
tans, their lips, their asses, Jay-
Z tickets, you name it, cause they
wanna be us.
92.
(MORE)
So they got to be for a night.I’m
not about to go out into the
streets in protest of a Halloween
party.
Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
realizes it’s herself she’s trying to convince.
Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.
89 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 89
Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her
lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.
90 EXT. KURT’S YARD - NIGHT 90
Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the
ground.
KURT
Dude. I know you can’t help it...
Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.
KURT (CONT’D)
...but why are you such a fag dude?
Lionel spits in Kurt’s face and pops right back up again. We
see it in his eyes - he’ll never give up.
Kurt’s hand is on Lionel’s collar. He pushes him down again.
Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.
Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt’s eyes.
Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.
LIONEL
Finally got me where you want me.
Kurt’s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.
Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt’s let up. For a
moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.
The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.
The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.
93.
COCO (CONT’D)
Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -
One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a
couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.
91 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 91
The motor on Sam’s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a
complete standstill.
Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact
with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.
Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos.
Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What is all this?
92 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92
A SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN
We see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.
CUT TO:
92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A
party. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.
Windows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the
lawn. Ash where fires were put out.
KURT
I didn’t do this. Sam. I had
nothing to do with this.
CUT TO:
92B MORNING NEWS 92B
ANCHOR
What some are calling a “race war”
has erupted at one of the nation’s
oldest and most prestigious --
CUT TO:
92 GILLESPIE FORUM now filled with students who sit before 92
Dean Fairbanks and President Fletcher for a Town Hall.
Everyone wears a look of outrage.
94.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We don’t condone this egregious
event and are investigating its
origins. The president and I are
looking at ways to address issues
of Diversity at Manchester.
REGGIE
HOUSING REFORM!
Applause breaks out amongst the crowd. But so do boos.
CUT TO:
93 VARIOUS SPOTS AROUND CAMPUS. Students address the camera. 93
MITCH
I’m sorry but it’s bullshit. Yo
this is how we get down. If you
can’t take a joke in this day and
age? The fact we can joke about it
proves we’ve moved on you feel me?
This is an attack on free speech!
We’re the victims here!
CUT TO:
93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A
of Armstrong / Parker where Lionel address the camera...
LIONEL
It’s hard enough for us to even get
into a school like this. Let alone
succeed. Find our way. This is only
a debate because of who Kurt’s dad
is, which just proves the point.
All you did was have a radio show
and look what happened to you.
CUT TO:
93B COCO as she talks directly to camera. 93B
COCO
I know this may come as a shock,
but nobody gives a fuck about no

CUT TO:

93C A POSTER featuring Troy rendered like the famous Shepard 93C
Fairy Obama posters with the words “A NEW HOPE” written at
the bottom as well as “TROY BROUSSARD FOR PRESIDENT.” This
gets some more applause from the crowd watching.
TROY
Of course I got my dad involved. It
was the right thing to do. I didn’t
mean for all this to happen. All
the posters and everything.
SAM (O.S.)
But you’d welcome it? A shot for
school president.
TROY
I think...I’d make more than few
people happy if I ran.
CUT TO:
93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. She 93D
lingers.
SAM (V.O.)
Even though I’d been expressly
forbidden to do so, I wanted to do
one last show. Something to sum up
the moment. To savor in the pop of
the post racial bubble just burst.
SAM
Dear White People...
SAM (V.O.)
I wanted to react.
Sam takes in a thoughtful breath before...
SAM
...Know what? Nevermind.
She fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her
headpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in:
“...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE”
Sam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on,
when all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE. Sam turns to
see that the entire room is on it’s feet including Prof
Bodkin and Gabe.
96.
94 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 94
Dean Fairbanks loosens his tie, flanked by several SCHOOL
OFFICIALS. They’ve been here for hours listening to...
KURT
Once I heard what the group was
planning, I sent out an email to
the staff to cancel it. You have
the email printed in front of you.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Who’s this?
Kurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him.
KURT
My lawyer.
CUT TO:
94B We’ll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B
COCO
So when I got the invite and saw
everyone clicking “yes” I figured
it was back on.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You were hoping to make the staff?
COCO
...
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
At what point in time did you show
up to the event?
94C Sam sits with arms folded. 94C
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Samantha. Please.
SAM
Why am I even here?
CUT TO:
KURT
94 Guys throw parties at the house all 94
the time.
97.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We know you were planning this.
KURT
Your son tell you that?
CUT TO:
94D Fairbanks stares down his son. Troy is silent and anxious.9 4D
DEAN FAIRBANKS
(reading)
“...wishing you could sip on Henny
out yo crunk cup without a Bitch
giving you the side-eye?”
(and then)
You write this Troy?
Troy looks up at his father embarrassed.
TROY
No. Mine wasn’t chosen.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you wanted to be?
TROY
What I wanted didn’t matter then.
Why should it matter now? I told
you about the party, remember?
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94
Facebook account.
KURT
I loathe Facebook.
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear.
KURT (CONT’D)
You’ve got to believe me.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’ve used that line on me before
this year Mr. Fletcher. When a
homophobic message mysteriously
appeared on a voice mail line you
shared with a roommate.
CUT TO:
98.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
What were your intentions when you
went back the second time?
LIONEL
To stop it.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
By any means necessary?
LIONEL
Someone once told me...Manchester
is like jazz. I don’t know much
about jazz. But from what I can
tell, when your solo’s up, you
better blow.
Fairbanks fights a smile.
CUT TO:
94C SAM 94C
All I did that night was hit record
brother.
The Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and
looks out his huge windows onto the campus below.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials 94E
are taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day.
The Dean tries a few passwords.
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C
Want to hear something strange?
The Dean turns from the window.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
The Pastiche group page hadn’t been
used for months, until the invite
went out.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries a different password. Still invalid. 94E
CUT TO:
99.
94C SAM 94C
Fascinating.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Well what’s interesting is how easy
it was to access the group before
the note was sent. The password was
“Pa$tiche” spelled with a dollar
sign according to Kurt. Seems
recently it’s been changed.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries one more. It works. 94E
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D) 94C
Couldn’t figure it out at first.
Then I thought to try something.
Five, seven, eight, three, five,
twenty six, one, nine, four, six.
Eleven numbers. Just like our
student ID numbers. Just like your
student ID number.
SAM
As much as you hate him, you will
stop at nothing to protect your
master and his boy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Did you send out the invite Sam?
SAM
That invite, whoever sent it
should’ve been met with derision
and outrage. Instead, a hundred
people showed up and they pulled
out posters and decorations and
costumes they’d made for just such
an occasion.
Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.
Silence falls in the room. The Dean’s mind ticks.
95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95
A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the
headline: “INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO
EXPULSIONS MADE”
100.
Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT
OBSERVER. The headline reads: “EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE
HARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...
96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL’S APARTMENT - DAY 96
Lionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied
grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.
LIONEL
2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless
complex depictions of whites, white
men in particular exist - there
aren’t that many versions of us in
the culture.
His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and
fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel’s head.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Culture has a powerful way of
telling people what they can and
can’t be. For people of color the
options are rather limited.
TROY
Next James Baldwin up in here. Wait
hold on a sec.
Star Trek is back from commercial break. Troy and Lionel
watch in silence.
97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97
Gabe is just about finished with Lionel’s article too. Looks
up just in time to see...
GABE
Hello Sam.
Sam sneers at his formalities.
GABE (CONT’D)
Read about Armstrong / Parker.
SAM
Yeah. Prez made an executive
withdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.
GABE
Congrats?
101.
SAM
(with a shrug)
Getting too dramatic man. Thinking
about getting an apartment off
campus. We’ll see.
GABE
Sam going against the grain?
Shocked. How’s papa White?
SAM
He’s recovering.
GABE
Good. Well...
Gabe fights the urge to hug her.
SAM
We were actually on the phone last
night for hours. First time we
talked since the bypass. He was
putting up a strong front. Teasing
me about being so worried. Then
came the stories about me as a
little girl I’d heard a thousand
times. About how independent I was.
Gabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.
GABE
Want to talk about it?
SAM
My mother worked nights so he would
take me to school. And it pissed me
off because he would follow me all
the way to homeroom. Every time he
tried to hold my hand I’d scream
and pull away. He thought I was
just being...difficult.
A hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?
SAM (CONT’D)
But it was the kids. And the
parents and the teachers. They’d
see this Black girl and this white
man and wonder what we were doing
together. Even at nine I could feel
their eyes on me. Especially at
nine. It brought tears to my eyes.
Gabe’s stone face melts at this.
102.
SAM (CONT’D)
I was just a bratty girl, didn’t
know any better but-- The thought
of losing him-- You know? I just
feel so bad. How awful am I to do
that to him? To anyone I love?
Gabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His
arm is on her shoulder now.
GABE
I’m sure he forgives you.
SAM
Think so?
Gabe nods. Sam’s normal defenses come back up lest she cries.
SAM (CONT’D)
So anyway. I didn’t mean to say all
of that. I don’t know why I did.
GABE
Sam. Where are you going?
SAM
I don’t know. Lunch?
Gabe starts to walk with her.
GABE
Isn’t it Mac and Cheese day at
Armstrong/Parker?
SAM
Think they’ll let you in?
Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam
lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into
each others’ eyes.
Don’t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.
98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98
Coco sits across from Helmut. He’s got his eyes on a Youtube
clip from Sam’s movie featuring Coco.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
I know this may come as a shock,
but they don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...
103.
HELMUT
Two hundred thousand views. Look
they even auto-tuned it.
With a click Helmut pulls it up.
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin
Tubman! Don’t give a fuck about no
muthafuckin Tubman!
Coco’s not sure what to think.
HELMUT
Couple months, that’s how long
shooting for an episode takes. We
recommend you cut your course load
in half to accommodate the
schedule.
COCO
Half?
HELMUT
Trust me it it’ll read “full-time”
in the episode. If...once we go to
series, we might have to figure out
a summer schedule.
COCO
For shooting?
HELMUT
For uh...classes and stuff. Won’t
be graduating early anymore
sweetheart.
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Five grand for the episode. Twenty
each if you get picked up for
series. What do you say?
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Trust me sweetie it’s the same out
there as it is in here. Good news
is? Against all that damn white you
and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be
the go-to producer for all things
Black?
104.
Coco shrugs.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Tell you what’s worse though. Being
that broke Nigga stuck on the south
side of Chicago. Hundred and
Fiftieth street.
Coco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --
99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99
Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He’s flanked
by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other
BoFros. They all carry Troy’s “New Hope” posters.
COCO
Made some new friends?
Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and
shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn’t approve.
COCO (CONT’D)
Fine.
TROY
Come on Coco.
COCO
Fuck you.
Coco starts to walk ahead.
TROY
My dad saw your videos. He’s a
little worried about --
COCO
-- how it’ll look. With your
campaign and all. What’s your best
friend Reggie think?
Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.
TROY
We had fun, alright?
COCO
I get everyone else wants you to
win Troy. But do you?
Troy doesn’t know how to answer that. He stares at the
triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.
105.
Coco’s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.
Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
Sungmi. They both know that look well...
SAM
Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy
moving on - A/P’s going to need a
new head of house.
LIONEL
Think there’s a story there? Who do
you think it’ll be?
Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
What? No.
SUNGMI
Everyone loves you. Won’t be hard
to rally the vote.
SAM
Yeah. We got you man.
Lionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.
100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100
Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher’s office to join
him at his desk. They’re all ears as they look across to...
HELMUT
Let me get this straight. First you
tried to break up the Black house.
Then you took down the sister with
the little radio show. And after
all that, your kid throws a
Blackface party?
FLETCHER
Now wait a minute!
HELMUT
You thought you were having money
problems before? Wait till cable
gets their hands on this story.
Bill Maher is gon’ fuck you up!
FLETCHER
I have heard enough --
106.
HELMUT
-- Wait I’m sorry. Look from where
I’m sitting this place is a
goldmine.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What?
HELMUT
For one we got to show the events
that led up to the party --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- That already happened.
HELMUT
Well yeah, but we can reenact --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- reenact?
HELMUT
Documentary term...Look, I can
start putting together an overall
deal today. I’m talking real money!
Turns out the one thing America
likes in it’s reality more than
ignant Black folks, is crazy racist
White people!
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Now you look here. This is an
honorable institution. The idea
that we would so much as entertain
this suggestion --
Fletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.
FLETCHER
How much we talking?
Fairbanks’ outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one
winner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.

Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipotent nature's incorrupted benefaction. For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that all hardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.

To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!
Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.

Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.

Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are won't that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.

In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin. Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.

Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.

As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.

And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.

And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with wonder pondering.

Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.

For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his won't was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.

But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.

About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul's bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. What means this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman's womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'était le sacre pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality ODER consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne's house rest should reign.
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid's Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres, pro memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell's gates visited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.

Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.

_Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac._
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne's hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart's side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.
But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.

This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne's. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy's, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, be having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king's bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:

_--Pope Peter's but a pissabed. A man's a man for a' that._

Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator. Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.

Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she ain't in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. 'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.

But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.
But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer's ground.
What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath 'twas done but--hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.

Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient won't. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.

The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!
There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTA giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergangliche_) in her glad look.
Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.
Burke's! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?

The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._ God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air. Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man's work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod's slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and never--do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh Trübsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters_. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother's milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan's land. Thy cow's dug was tough, what? Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this but thick rich bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! _Per deam Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum_!

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
[Verse 1]
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town

[Bridge 1]
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

Good morning, good morning

People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_I%20Cant%20Believe%20That%20Youre%20in%20Love%20With%20Me_The%20Chocolate%20Dandies.ttl,George Bernard Shaw,Arms and the Man (Act 1),"Night. A lady's bedchamber in Bulgaria, in a small town near the Dragoman Pass. It is late in November in the year 1885, and through an open window with a little balcony on the left can be seen a peak of the Balkans, wonderfully white and beautiful in the starlit snow. The interior of the room is not like anything to be seen in the east of Europe. It is half rich Bulgarian, half cheap Viennese. The counterpane and hangings of the bed, the window curtains, the little carpet, and all the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are oriental and gorgeous: the paper on the walls is occidental and paltry. Above the head of the bed, which stands against a little wall cutting off the right hand corner of the room diagonally, is a painted wooden shrine, blue and gold, with an ivory image of Christ, and a light hanging before it in a pierced metal ball suspended by three chains. On the left, further forward, is an ottoman. The washstand, against the wall on the left, consists of an enamelled iron basin with a pail beneath it in a painted metal frame, and a single towel on the rail at the side. A chair near it is Austrian bent wood, with cane seat. The dressing table, between the bed and the window, is an ordinary pine table, covered with a cloth of many colors, but with an expensive toilet mirror on it. The door is on the right; and there is a chest of drawers between the door and the bed. This chest of drawers is also covered by a variegated native cloth, and on it there is a pile of paper backed novels, a box of chocolate creams, and a miniature easel, on which is a large photograph of an extremely handsome officer, whose lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even from the portrait. The room is lighted by a candle on the chest of drawers, and another on the dressing table, with a box of matches beside it.

The window is hinged doorwise and stands wide open, folding back to the left. Outside a pair of wooden shutters, opening outwards, also stand open. On the balcony, a young lady, intensely conscious of the romantic beauty of the night, and of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part of it, is on the balcony, gazing at the snowy Balkans. She is covered by a long mantle of furs, worth, on a moderate estimate, about three times the furniture of her room.

Her reverie is interrupted by her mother, Catherine Petkoff, a woman over forty, imperiously energetic, with magnificent black hair and eyes, who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife of a mountain farmer, but is determined to be a Viennese lady, and to that end wears a fashionable tea gown on all occasions.

CATHERINE
(entering hastily, full of good news). Raina—(she pronounces it Rah-eena, with the stress on the ee) Raina—(she goes to the bed, expecting to find Raina there.) Why, where—(Raina looks into the room.) Heavens! child, are you out in the night air instead of in your bed? You'll catch your death. Louka told me you were asleep.

RAINA
(coming in). I sent her away. I wanted to be alone. The stars are so beautiful! What is the matter?

CATHERINE
Such news. There has been a battle!

RAINA
(her eyes dilating). Ah! (She throws the cloak on the ottoman, and comes eagerly to Catherine in her nightgown, a pretty garment, but evidently the only one she has on.)

CATHERINE
A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory! And it was won by Sergius.

RAINA
(with a cry of delight). Ah! (Rapturously.) Oh, mother! (Then, with sudden anxiety) Is father safe?

CATHERINE
Of course: he sent me the news. Sergius is the hero of the hour, the idol of the regiment.
RAINA
Tell me, tell me. How was it! (Ecstatically) Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and they kiss one another frantically.)

CATHERINE
(with surging enthusiasm). You can't guess how splendid it is. A cavalry charge—think of that! He defied our Russian commanders—acted without orders—led a charge on his own responsibility—headed it himself—was the first man to sweep through their guns. Can't you see it, Raina; our gallant splendid Bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing, thundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched Servian dandies like chaff. And you—you kept Sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him. Oh, if you have a drop of Bulgarian blood in your veins, you will worship him when he comes back.

RAINA
What will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole army of heroes? But no matter: I am so happy—so proud! (She rises and walks about excitedly.) It proves that all our ideas were real after all.

CATHERINE
(indignantly). Our ideas real! What do you mean?

RAINA
Our ideas of what Sergius would do—our patriotism—our heroic ideals. Oh, what faithless little creatures girls are!—I sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams. When I buckled on Sergius's sword he looked so noble: it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure. And yet—and yet—(Quickly.) Promise me you'll never tell him.

CATHERINE
Don't ask me for promises until I know what I am promising.

RAINA
Well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading Byron and Pushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera that season at Bucharest. Real life is so seldom like that—indeed never, as far as I knew it then. (Remorsefully.) Only think, mother, I doubted him: I wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle. I had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever Russian officers.

CATHERINE
A poor figure! Shame on you! The Servians have Austrian officers who are just as clever as our Russians; but we have beaten them in every battle for all that.

RAINA
(laughing and sitting down again). Yes, I was only a prosaic little coward. Oh, to think that it was all true—that Sergius is just as splendid and noble as he looks—that the world is really a glorious world for women who can see its glory and men who can act its romance! What happiness! what unspeakable fulfilment! Ah! (She throws herself on her knees beside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her. They are interrupted by the entry of Louka, a handsome, proud girl in a pretty Bulgarian peasant's dress with double apron, so defiant that her servility to Raina is almost insolent. She is afraid of Catherine, but even with her goes as far as she dares. She is just now excited like the others; but she has no sympathy for Raina's raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies of the two before she addresses them.)
LOUKA
If you please, madam, all the windows are to be closed and the shutters made fast. They say there may be shooting in the streets. (Raina and Catherine rise together, alarmed.) The Servians are being chased right back through the pass; and they say they may run into the town. Our cavalry will be after them; and our people will be ready for them you may be sure, now that they are running away. (She goes out on the balcony and pulls the outside shutters to; then steps back into the room.)

RAINA
I wish our people were not so cruel. What glory is there in killing wretched fugitives?

CATHERINE
(business-like, her housekeeping instincts aroused). I must see that everything is made safe downstairs.

RAINA
(to Louka). Leave the shutters so that I can just close them if I hear any noise.

CATHERINE
(authoritatively, turning on her way to the door). Oh, no, dear, you must keep them fastened. You would be sure to drop off to sleep and leave them open. Make them fast, Louka.

LOUKA
Yes, madam. (She fastens them.)

RAINA
Don't be anxious about me. The moment I hear a shot, I shall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my ears well covered.

CATHERINE
Quite the wisest thing you can do, my love. Good-night.

RAINA
Good-night. (They kiss one another, and Raina's emotion comes back for a moment.) Wish me joy of the happiest night of my life—if only there are no fugitives.
CATHERINE
Go to bed, dear; and don't think of them. (She goes out.)

LOUKA
(secretly, to Raina). If you would like the shutters open, just give them a push like this. (She pushes them: they open: she pulls them to again.) One of them ought to be bolted at the bottom; but the bolt's gone.

RAINA
(with dignity, reproving her). Thanks, Louka; but we must do what we are told. (Louka makes a grimace.) Good-night.

LOUKA
(carelessly). Good-night. (She goes out, swaggering.)
(Raina, left alone, goes to the chest of drawers, and adores the portrait there with feelings that are beyond all expression. She does not kiss it or press it to her breast, or shew it any mark of bodily affection; but she takes it in her hands and elevates it like a priestess.)

RAINA
(looking up at the picture with worship.) Oh, I shall never be unworthy of you any more, my hero—never, never, never. (She replaces it reverently, and selects a novel from the little pile of books. She turns over the leaves dreamily; finds her page; turns the book inside out at it; and then, with a happy sigh, gets into bed and prepares to read herself to sleep. But before abandoning herself to fiction, she raises her eyes once more, thinking of the blessed reality and murmurs) My hero! my hero!
(A distant shot breaks the quiet of the night outside. She starts, listening; and two more shots, much nearer, follow, startling her so that she scrambles out of bed, and hastily blows out the candle on the chest of drawers. Then, putting her fingers in her ears, she runs to the dressing-table and blows out the light there, and hurries back to bed. The room is now in darkness: nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in the pierced ball before the image, and the starlight seen through the slits at the top of the shutters. The firing breaks out again: there is a startling fusillade quite close at hand. Whilst it is still echoing, the shutters disappear, pulled open from without, and for an instant the rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the figure of a man in black upon it. The shutters close immediately and the room is dark again. But the silence is now broken by the sound of panting. Then there is a scrape; and the flame of a match is seen in the middle of the room.)

RAINA
(crouching on the bed). Who's there? (The match is out instantly.) Who's there? Who is that?

A MAN'S VOICE
(in the darkness, subduedly, but threateningly). Sh—sh! Don't call out or you'll be shot. Be good; and no harm will happen to you. (She is heard leaving her bed, and making for the door.) Take care, there's no use in trying to run away. Remember, if you raise your voice my pistol will go off. (Commandingly.) Strike a light and let me see you. Do you hear? (Another moment of silence and darkness. Then she is heard retreating to the dressing-table. She lights a candle, and the mystery is at an end. A man of about 35, in a deplorable plight, bespattered with mud and blood and snow, his belt and the strap of his revolver case keeping together the torn ruins of the blue coat of a Servian artillery officer. As far as the candlelight and his unwashed, unkempt condition make it possible to judge, he is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance, with strong neck and shoulders, a roundish, obstinate looking head covered with short crisp bronze curls, clear quick blue eyes and good brows and mouth, a hopelessly prosaic nose like that of a strong-minded baby, trim soldierlike carriage and energetic manner, and with all his wits about him in spite of his desperate predicament—even with a sense of humor of it, without, however, the least intention of trifling with it or throwing away a chance. He reckons up what he can guess about Raina—her age, her social position, her character, the extent to which she is frightened—at a glance, and continues, more politely but still most determinedly) Excuse my disturbing you; but you recognise my uniform—Servian. If I'm caught I shall be killed. (Determinedly.) Do you understand that?

RAINA
Yes.

MAN
Well, I don't intend to get killed if I can help it. (Still more determinedly.) Do you understand that? (He locks the door with a snap.)

RAINA
(disdainfully). I suppose not. (She draws herself up superbly, and looks him straight in the face, saying with emphasis) Some soldiers, I know, are afraid of death.

MAN
(with grim goodhumor). All of them, dear lady, all of them, believe me. It is our duty to live as long as we can, and kill as many of the enemy as we can. Now if you raise an alarm—

RAINA
(cutting him short). You will shoot me. How do you know that I am afraid to die?

MAN
(cunningly). Ah; but suppose I don't shoot you, what will happen then? Why, a lot of your cavalry—the greatest blackguards in your army—will burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig; for I'll fight like a demon: they shan't get me into the street to amuse themselves with: I know what they are. Are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress? (Raina, suddenly conscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her. He watches her, and adds, pitilessly) It's rather scanty, eh? (She turns to the ottoman. He raises his pistol instantly, and cries) Stop! (She stops.) Where are you going?

RAINA
(with dignified patience). Only to get my cloak.
MAN (darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak). A good idea. No: I'll keep the cloak: and you will take care that nobody comes in and sees you without it. This is a better weapon than the pistol. (He throws the pistol down on the ottoman.)
RAINA (revolted). It is not the weapon of a gentleman!

MAN
It's good enough for a man with only you to stand between him and death. (As they look at one another for a moment, Raina hardly able to believe that even a Servian officer can be so cynically and selfishly unchivalrous, they are startled by a sharp fusillade in the street. The chill of imminent death hushes the man's voice as he adds) Do you hear? If you are going to bring those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you are. (Raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn. Suddenly he starts, listening. There is a step outside. Someone tries the door, and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it. Raina looks at the man, breathless. He throws up his head with the gesture of a man who sees that it is all over with him, and, dropping the manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her, flings the cloak to her, exclaiming, sincerely and kindly) No use: I'm done for. Quick! wrap yourself up: they're coming!

RAINA
(catching the cloak eagerly). Oh, thank you. (She wraps herself up with great relief. He draws his sabre and turns to the door, waiting.)

LOUKA
(outside, knocking). My lady, my lady! Get up, quick, and open the door.

RAINA
(anxiously). What will you do?

MAN
(grimly). Never mind. Keep out of the way. It will not last long.

RAINA
(impulsively). I'll help you. Hide yourself, oh, hide yourself, quick, behind the curtain. (She seizes him by a torn strip of his sleeve, and pulls him towards the window.)

MAN
(yielding to her). There is just half a chance, if you keep your head. Remember: nine soldiers out of ten are born fools. (He hides behind the curtain, looking out for a moment to say, finally) If they find me, I promise you a fight—a devil of a fight! (He disappears. Raina takes of the cloak and throws it across the foot of the bed. Then with a sleepy, disturbed air, she opens the door. Louka enters excitedly.)

LOUKA
A man has been seen climbing up the water-pipe to your balcony—a Servian. The soldiers want to search for him; and they are so wild and drunk and furious. My lady says you are to dress at once.

RAINA
(as if annoyed at being disturbed). They shall not search here. Why have they been let in?

CATHERINE
(coming in hastily). Raina, darling, are you safe? Have you seen anyone or heard anything?

RAINA
I heard the shooting. Surely the soldiers will not dare come in here?

CATHERINE
I have found a Russian officer, thank Heaven: he knows Sergius. (Speaking through the door to someone outside.) Sir, will you come in now! My daughter is ready.

(A young Russian officer, in Bulgarian uniform, enters, sword in hand.)

THE OFFICER
(with soft, feline politeness and stiff military carriage). Good evening, gracious lady; I am sorry to intrude, but there is a fugitive hiding on the balcony. Will you and the gracious lady your mother please to withdraw whilst we search?

RAINA
(petulantly). Nonsense, sir, you can see that there is no one on the balcony. (She throws the shutters wide open and stands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden, pointing to the moonlit balcony. A couple of shots are fired right under the window, and a bullet shatters the glass opposite Raina, who winks and gasps, but stands her ground, whilst Catherine screams, and the officer rushes to the balcony.)

THE OFFICER
(on the balcony, shouting savagely down to the street). Cease firing there, you fools: do you hear? Cease firing, damn you. (He glares down for a moment; then turns to Raina, trying to resume his polite manner.) Could anyone have got in without your knowledge? Were you asleep?

RAINA
No, I have not been to bed.

THE OFFICER
(impatiently, coming back into the room). Your neighbours have their heads so full of runaway Servians that they see them everywhere. (Politely.) Gracious lady, a thousand pardons. Good-night. (Military bow, which Raina returns coldly. Another to Catherine, who follows him out. Raina closes the shutters. She turns and sees Louka, who has been watching the scene curiously.)

RAINA
Don't leave my mother, Louka, whilst the soldiers are here. (Louka glances at Raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain; then purses her lips secretively, laughs to herself, and goes out. Raina follows her to the door, shuts it behind her with a slam, and locks it violently. The man immediately steps out from behind the curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way.)

MAN
A narrow shave; but a miss is as good as a mile. Dear young lady, your servant until death. I wish for your sake I had joined the Bulgarian army instead of the Servian. I am not a native Servian.

RAINA
(haughtily). No, you are one of the Austrians who set the Servians on to rob us of our national liberty, and who officer their army for them. We hate them!

MAN
Austrian! not I. Don't hate me, dear young lady. I am only a Swiss, fighting merely as a professional soldier. I joined Servia because it was nearest to me. Be generous: you've beaten us hollow.

RAINA
Have I not been generous?

MAN
Noble!—heroic! But I'm not saved yet. This particular rush will soon pass through; but the pursuit will go on all night by fits and starts. I must take my chance to get off during a quiet interval. You don't mind my waiting just a minute or two, do you?

RAINA
Oh, no: I am sorry you will have to go into danger again. (Motioning towards ottoman.) Won't you sit—(She breaks off with an irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the pistol. The man, all nerves, shies like a frightened horse.)

MAN
(irritably). Don't frighten me like that. What is it?

RAINA
Your pistol! It was staring that officer in the face all the time. What an escape!

MAN (vexed at being unnecessarily terrified). Oh, is that all?

RAINA (staring at him rather superciliously, conceiving a poorer and poorer opinion of him, and feeling proportionately more and more at her ease with him). I am sorry I frightened you. (She takes up the pistol and hands it to him.) Pray take it to protect yourself against me.

MAN
(grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol). No use, dear young lady: there's nothing in it. It's not loaded. (He makes a grimace at it, and drops it disparagingly into his revolver case.)
RAINA. Load it by all means.

MAN
I've no ammunition. What use are cartridges in battle? I always carry chocolate instead; and I finished the last cake of that yesterday.

RAINA
(outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood). Chocolate! Do you stuff your pockets with sweets—like a schoolboy—even in the field?

MAN
Yes. Isn't it contemptible?

(Raina stares at him, unable to utter her feelings. Then she sails away scornfully to the chest of drawers, and returns with the box of confectionery in her hand.)

RAINA
Allow me. I am sorry I have eaten them all except these. (She offers him the box.)

MAN
(ravenously). You're an angel! (He gobbles the comfits.) Creams! Delicious! (He looks anxiously to see whether there are any more. There are none. He accepts the inevitable with pathetic goodhumor, and says, with grateful emotion) Bless you, dear lady. You can always tell an old soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes. The young ones carry pistols and cartridges; the old ones, grub. Thank you. (He hands back the box. She snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it away. This impatient action is so sudden that he shies again.) Ugh! Don't do things so suddenly, gracious lady. Don't revenge yourself because I frightened you just now.

RAINA
(superbly). Frighten me! Do you know, sir, that though I am only a woman, I think I am at heart as brave as you.

MAN
I should think so. You haven't been under fire for three days as I have. I can stand two days without shewing it much; but no man can stand three days: I'm as nervous as a mouse. (He sits down on the ottoman, and takes his head in his hands.) Would you like to see me cry?

RAINA
(quickly). No.

MAN
If you would, all you have to do is to scold me just as if I were a little boy and you my nurse. If I were in camp now they'd play all sorts of tricks on me.

RAINA
(a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you. (Touched by the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks gratefully at her: she immediately draws hack and says stiffly) You must excuse me: our soldiers are not like that. (She moves away from the ottoman.)

MAN
Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that you've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war, nothing else. (Indignantly.) I never saw anything so unprofessional.

RAINA
(ironically). Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you?

MAN
Well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire? I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it.

RAINA
(eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her). Did you see the great cavalry charge? Oh, tell me about it. Describe it to me.

MAN
You never saw a cavalry charge, did you?

RAINA
How could I?

MAN
Ah, perhaps not—of course. Well, it's a funny sight. It's like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one comes; then two or three close behind him; and then all the rest in a lump.

RAINA
(her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically). Yes, first One!—the bravest of the brave!

MAN
(prosaically). Hm! you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse.

RAINA
Why should he pull at his horse?

MAN
(impatient of so stupid a question). It's running away with him, of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed? Then they all come. You can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing. The old ones come bunched up under the number one guard: they know that they are mere projectiles, and that it's no use trying to fight. The wounds are mostly broken knees, from the horses cannoning together.

RAINA
Ugh! But I don't believe the first man is a coward. I believe he is a hero!

MAN
(goodhumoredly). That's what you'd have said if you'd seen the first man in the charge to-day.

RAINA
(breathless). Ah, I knew it! Tell me—tell me about him.

MAN
He did it like an operatic tenor—a regular handsome fellow, with flashing eyes and lovely moustache, shouting a war-cry and charging like Don Quixote at the windmills. We nearly burst with laughter at him; but when the sergeant ran up as white as a sheet, and told us they'd sent us the wrong cartridges, and that we couldn't fire a shot for the next ten minutes, we laughed at the other side of our mouths. I never felt so sick in my life, though I've been in one or two very tight places. And I hadn't even a revolver cartridge—nothing but chocolate. We'd no bayonets—nothing. Of course, they just cut us to bits. And there was Don Quixote flourishing like a drum major, thinking he'd done the cleverest thing ever known, whereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it. Of all the fools ever let loose on a field of battle, that man must be the very maddest. He and his regiment simply committed suicide—only the pistol missed fire, that's all.

RAINA
(deeply wounded, but steadfastly loyal to her ideals). Indeed! Would you know him again if you saw him?

MAN
Shall I ever forget him. (She again goes to the chest of drawers. He watches her with a vague hope that she may have something else for him to eat. She takes the portrait from its stand and brings it to him.)

RAINA
That is a photograph of the gentleman—the patriot and hero—to whom I am betrothed.

MAN
(looking at it). I'm really very sorry. (Looking at her.) Was it fair to lead me on? (He looks at the portrait again.) Yes: that's him: not a doubt of it. (He stifles a laugh.)

RAINA
(quickly). Why do you laugh?

MAN
(shamefacedly, but still greatly tickled). I didn't laugh, I assure you. At least I didn't mean to. But when I think of him charging the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest thing—(chokes with suppressed laughter).

RAINA
(sternly). Give me back the portrait, sir.

MAN
(with sincere remorse). Of course. Certainly. I'm really very sorry. (She deliberately kisses it, and looks him straight in the face, before returning to the chest of drawers to replace it. He follows her, apologizing.) Perhaps I'm quite wrong, you know: no doubt I am. Most likely he had got wind of the cartridge business somehow, and knew it was a safe job.

RAINA
That is to say, he was a pretender and a coward! You did not dare say that before.

MAN
(with a comic gesture of despair). It's no use, dear lady: I can't make you see it from the professional point of view. (As he turns away to get back to the ottoman, the firing begins again in the distance.)

RAINA
(sternly, as she sees him listening to the shots). So much the better for you.

MAN
(turning). How?

RAINA
You are my enemy; and you are at my mercy. What would I do if I were a professional soldier?

MAN
Ah, true, dear young lady: you're always right. I know how good you have been to me: to my last hour I shall remember those three chocolate creams. It was unsoldierly; but it was angelic.

RAINA
(coldly). Thank you. And now I will do a soldierly thing. You cannot stay here after what you have just said about my future husband; but I will go out on the balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the street. (She turns to the window.)

MAN
(changing countenance). Down that waterpipe! Stop! Wait! I can't! I daren't! The very thought of it makes me giddy. I came up it fast enough with death behind me. But to face it now in cold blood!—(He sinks on the ottoman.) It's no use: I give up: I'm beaten. Give the alarm. (He drops his head in his hands in the deepest dejection.)

RAINA
(disarmed by pity). Come, don't be disheartened. (She stoops over him almost maternally: he shakes his head.) Oh, you are a very poor soldier—a chocolate cream soldier. Come, cheer up: it takes less courage to climb down than to face capture—remember that.

MAN
(dreamily, lulled by her voice). No, capture only means death; and death is sleep—oh, sleep, sleep, sleep, undisturbed sleep! Climbing down the pipe means doing something—exerting myself—thinking! Death ten times over first.

RAINA
(softly and wonderingly, catching the rhythm of his weariness). Are you so sleepy as that?
MAN. I've not had two hours' undisturbed sleep since the war began. I'm on the staff: you don't know what that means. I haven't closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.

RAINA
(desperately). But what am I to do with you.

MAN
(staggering up). Of course I must do something. (He shakes himself; pulls himself together; and speaks with rallied vigour and courage.) You see, sleep or no sleep, hunger or no hunger, tired or not tired, you can always do a thing when you know it must be done. Well, that pipe must be got down—(He hits himself on the chest, and adds)—Do you hear that, you chocolate cream soldier? (He turns to the window.)

RAINA
(anxiously). But if you fall?

MAN
I shall sleep as if the stones were a feather bed. Good-bye. (He makes boldly for the window, and his hand is on the shutter when there is a terrible burst of firing in the street beneath.)

RAINA
(rushing to him). Stop! (She catches him by the shoulder, and turns him quite round.) They'll kill you.

MAN
(coolly, but attentively). Never mind: this sort of thing is all in my day's work. I'm bound to take my chance. (Decisively.) Now do what I tell you. Put out the candles, so that they shan't see the light when I open the shutters. And keep away from the window, whatever you do. If they see me, they're sure to have a shot at me.

RAINA
(clinging to him). They're sure to see you: it's bright moonlight. I'll save you—oh, how can you be so indifferent? You want me to save you, don't you?

MAN
I really don't want to be troublesome. (She shakes him in her impatience.) I am not indifferent, dear young lady, I assure you. But how is it to be done?

RAINA
Come away from the window—please. (She coaxes him back to the middle of the room. He submits humbly. She releases him, and addresses him patronizingly.) Now listen. You must trust to our hospitality. You do not yet know in whose house you are. I am a Petkoff.

MAN
What's that?

RAINA
(rather indignantly). I mean that I belong to the family of the Petkoffs, the richest and best known in our country.

MAN
Oh, yes, of course. I beg your pardon. The Petkoffs, to be sure. How stupid of me!

RAINA
You know you never heard of them until this minute. How can you stoop to pretend?

MAN
Forgive me: I'm too tired to think; and the change of subject was too much for me. Don't scold me.

RAINA
I forgot. It might make you cry. (He nods, quite seriously. She pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone.) I must tell you that my father holds the highest command of any Bulgarian in our army. He is (proudly) a Major.

MAN
(pretending to be deeply impressed). A Major! Bless me! Think of that!

RAINA
You shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was necessary to climb up to the balcony, because ours is the only private house that has two rows of windows. There is a flight of stairs inside to get up and down by.

MAN
Stairs! How grand! You live in great luxury indeed, dear young lady.

RAINA
Do you know what a library is?

MAN
A library? A roomful of books.

RAINA
Yes, we have one, the only one in Bulgaria.

MAN
Actually a real library! I should like to see that.

RAINA
(affectedly). I tell you these things to shew you that you are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your Servian uniform, but among civilized people. We go to Bucharest every year for the opera season; and I have spent a whole month in Vienna.

MAN
I saw that, dear young lady. I saw at once that you knew the world.

RAINA
Have you ever seen the opera of Ernani?

MAN
Is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet, and a soldier's chorus?

RAINA
(contemptuously). No!

MAN
(stifling a heavy sigh of weariness). Then I don't know it.

RAINA
I thought you might have remembered the great scene where Ernani, flying from his foes just as you are tonight, takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy, an old Castilian noble. The noble refuses to give him up. His guest is sacred to him.

MAN
(quickly waking up a little). Have your people got that notion?

RAINA
(with dignity). My mother and I can understand that notion, as you call it. And if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as safe as in your father's house.

MAN
Quite sure?

RAINA
(turning her back on him in disgust.) Oh, it is useless to try and make you understand.

MAN
Don't be angry: you see how awkward it would be for me if there was any mistake. My father is a very hospitable man: he keeps six hotels; but I couldn't trust him as far as that. What about YOUR father?

RAINA
He is away at Slivnitza fighting for his country. I answer for your safety. There is my hand in pledge of it. Will that reassure you? (She offers him her hand.)

MAN
(looking dubiously at his own hand). Better not touch my hand, dear young lady. I must have a wash first.

RAINA
(touched). That is very nice of you. I see that you are a gentleman.

MAN
(puzzled). Eh?

RAINA
You must not think I am surprised. Bulgarians of really good standing—people in OUR position—wash their hands nearly every day. But I appreciate your delicacy. You may take my hand. (She offers it again.)

MAN
(kissing it with his hands behind his back). Thanks, gracious young lady: I feel safe at last. And now would you mind breaking the news to your mother? I had better not stay here secretly longer than is necessary.

RAINA
If you will be so good as to keep perfectly still whilst I am away.

MAN
Certainly. (He sits down on the ottoman.)
(Raina goes to the bed and wraps herself in the fur cloak. His eyes close. She goes to the door, but on turning for a last look at him, sees that he is dropping of to sleep.)

RAINA
(at the door). You are not going asleep, are you? (He murmurs inarticulately: she runs to him and shakes him.) Do you hear? Wake up: you are falling asleep.

MAN
Eh? Falling aslee—? Oh, no, not the least in the world: I was only thinking. It's all right: I'm wide awake.

RAINA
(severely). Will you please stand up while I am away. (He rises reluctantly.) All the time, mind.

MAN
(standing unsteadily). Certainly—certainly: you may depend on me.

(Raina looks doubtfully at him. He smiles foolishly. She goes reluctantly, turning again at the door, and almost catching him in the act of yawning. She goes out.)

MAN
(drowsily). Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, slee—(The words trail off into a murmur. He wakes again with a shock on the point of falling.) Where am I? That's what I want to know: where am I? Must keep awake. Nothing keeps me awake except danger—remember that—(intently) danger, danger, danger, dan— Where's danger? Must find it. (He starts of vaguely around the room in search of it.) What am I looking for? Sleep—danger—don't know. (He stumbles against the bed.) Ah, yes: now I know. All right now. I'm to go to bed, but not to sleep—be sure not to sleep—because of danger. Not to lie down, either, only sit down. (He sits on the bed. A blissful expression comes into his face.) Ah! (With a happy sigh he sinks back at full length; lifts his boots into the bed with a final effort; and falls fast asleep instantly.)
(Catherine comes in, followed by Raina.)

RAINA
(looking at the ottoman). He's gone! I left him here.

CATHERINE
Here! Then he must have climbed down from the—

RAINA
(seeing him). Oh! (She points.)

CATHERINE
(scandalized). Well! (She strides to the left side of the bed, Raina following and standing opposite her on the right.) He's fast asleep. The brute!

RAINA
(anxiously). Sh!

CATHERINE
(shaking him). Sir! (Shaking him again, harder.) Sir!! (Vehemently shaking very bard.) Sir!!!

RAINA
(catching her arm). Don't, mamma: the poor dear is worn out. Let him sleep.

CATHERINE
(letting him go and turning amazed to Raina). The poor dear! Raina!!! (She looks sternly at her daughter. The man sleeps profoundly.)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 1]
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music

My heart gives a chil
I feel such a thrill
My feet won't keep still
When they swing that music
Rythm like that puts me in a trance
Oh you can't blame me for wanting to dance
From what I understand
It must be just grand
To play in a band
When they swing that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When they swing that music for me

With my eyes I can see
All of the glee
The bees in the knees
When they swing that music
Rythm like that don't do nothing but make me smile
Oh you can't blame me if I'm gone for a while
From what has been said
I'm getting ahead
I'll swing you to bed
Once they've swung that music
Oh I'm as happy as can be
When you swing that music with me
My head feels a buzz
A reason there was
I feel buzz because
They're swinging that music
Rythm like that sends me up the wall
Oh you can't blame me if I don't wanna fall
From what I have heard
It must mean the world
To dance with that girl

Outrage over an “African American

2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D

Last year the Dean’s office
celebrated slight gains in diverse
applicants but with many now
calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
that may have been pre-mature.
2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E
50’s fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.

3 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 3
This sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern
architecture is presented like a living brochure.
SUPERIMPOSE: MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - “NOSCE TE IPSUM”
As we cut through the living brochure, we’re presented with
groups and programs. Their CRESTS and titles SUPERIMPOSED.

3A White kids with “Trump” blazers and glares - DESMOND 3A
SCHOOL OF BUSINESS.
3B Kids with dark eye circles and unkempt hair stand before 3B

3C A cluster of skinny jeans and expressive hands before the 3C
GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL. ONE BLACK KID stands in the back.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People. The minimum
requirement of Black friends needed
to not seem racist has just been
raised to two.
4 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 4
Samantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way
window with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older.
She gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a
subversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan.

SAM (CONT’D)
Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone
does not count.
She fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to
address a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title
“EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE.” One by one she scribbles
her autograph on the books.
5 EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY 5
SERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS
Disheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE.
5A Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A
5B Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. His sweet but 5B
insecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head.
SUPERIMPOSE: LIONEL HIGGINS, JUNIOR, PHILOSOPHY UNDECLARED
STUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his
already full hands. Lionel’s a guppy. The kind that gets
eaten alive in a tank of sharks.
As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
checks his pockets. He’s missing something. Shit.
LIONEL
(knocking)
Kurt! You home?
Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel’s.
ANSWERING MACHINE
Hey boyssss, you’ve reached Lionel
Higginsss, the only bitch on
campussss who’ll give you a
dickssscount. That’s right hunty,
the bigger the dick the less you’ll
have to pay me to ssssuck it.
The beep sounds. Lionel’s in shock. Should he hang up? Or...
LIONEL
Kurt. It’s Lionel. I’m locked out.
As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It’s a rendering of Sam
White on a carton of milk with the caption:
“MISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK”
3.
6 EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY 6
Signs scream out “ORIENTATION” as jazz music wafts from the
laptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, apparently
Morgan Freeman in “Deep Impact”
wasn’t enough. Despite two terms
Obama could cure Cancer and
somewhere White folks will be
embroiled in protest. And he’s only
half Black.
GABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy
hair and “laundry day” flip flop clad ensemble, catches the
end of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...
7 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 7
...Sam presses a button next to a red light on her controls.
SAM
Talk to me.
INTERCUT with Gabe walking about on campus.
GABE
What would you say if someone
started a Dear Black People?
SAM
(recognizing the voice)
No need. Mass media from Fox News
to reality tv on VH1 makes it clear
what white people think of us.
8 EXT. MANCHESTER COURT - DAY 8
SERIES OF SHOTS - POPULAR RESIDENCE HALLS
Manchester’s white and rich elite before BECHET HOUSE.
8A Athletes of many disciplines before WEBSTER HOUSE. 8A

a sprinkling of whites before ARMSTRONG / PARKER HOUSE.
COCO (V.O.)
I’m fucking pissed...

11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
Colandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes
right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She’s
got an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
...I am! The whole point of
randomized housing is to mix shit
up. I’m out here trying to find the
Olivier to my Halle Berry, and
they’ve got me looking like an
extra on a Different World...
The video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a
30’s something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy
everything. Too stylish for this place. If he’s impressed,
it’s barely perceptible.
HELMUT
You call your Youtube show “Doing
Time at an Ivy League?”
He stares right at Coco, there in the flesh.
COCO
In my second year of a four year
sentence. Wanted to go to New York.
SUPERIMPOSE: COLANDREA COCO CONNERS, SOPHOMORE, ECONOMICS
HELMUT
Yeah? And do what?
COCO
Things my mama taught me not to.
You know get in a lot of trouble
and become famous for it. But alas
I didn’t get into Tisch...
HELMUT
Armstrong / Parker? That your
rooming assignment?
COCO
Traditionally it’s where the
hopelessly Afrocentric gather to
process their guilt over not going
to an HBCU.
(off Helmut’s look)
Where the Negros be at.
HELMUT
That’s not where you want to be?

HELMUT

COCO
Seventy Eighth and --
HELMUT
-- Seventy Eighth is Southside
sweetheart. And you know what they
say. You can take the girl out the
hood but --
COCO
-- Ain’t nothing hood about me.
HELMUT
Thanks so much for coming in.
Coco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.
COCO
So what’s this show about anyway?
HELMUT
Here’s the way reality works
sweetheart, I’m the producer. I ask
the questions. Be in touch.
And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders
before unmuting his iPad.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People I am here to
burst your post-racial little
bubble.
6.
(MORE)
Yes Oprah may have her own network,
but Ann Coulter is still writing
best sellers, Black kids are still
getting shot for wearing hoodies,
and even here the few vestiges of
Black culture are under attack by
conservative groups, trustees and
yes our very own President
Fletcher.
Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.
HELMUT
This is the school radio?
13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13
A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the
halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively
debates, flirt and bump the student radio.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, thanks to the
new process of randomizing housing
assignments for Sophomores, some of
you may be jarred by an assignment
to Armstrong/Parker house.
The owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks.
TROY
Someone turn that trash off.
SUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE
Even with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of
Jet. Troy exudes “approachable homie” as he spots a small
group of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall.
TROY (CONT’D)
Newbies right?
The white sophomores nod their heads yes.
TROY (CONT’D)
Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home
of the dopest dining hall in all of
Manchester. I’m Troy, Head of
House.
SOPHOMORE
What’s up my brother?

SAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
SAM (O.S.)
When encountering a Black person
try and stay calm. Don’t say things
like “what’s up” and “my brotha”
That’s not how you normally talk.
TROY
Ya’ll take care. Nice Jordan’s bro.
Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette
who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.
SOFIA
Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.
COCO
You’re so cute.
SOFIA
Is it weaved?
Coco’s face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
I saw “Good Hair” in Afro studies.
COCO
(moving on)
Hey what house did you get?
SOFIA
Huh? Oh Bechet bitch.
COCO
Of course. The mere thought of a
Fletcher anywhere else...
SOFIA
Easy, it was the luck of the draw.
Daddy had nothing to do with it.
Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
And honestly, if I had to pick
anywhere to be it’d be here.
Sofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.
COCO
I’m down to switch if you are. You
get your Denzel. I get my Gosling.
8.
SOFIA
Oh I got mines. Want to meet him?
They turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new
Sophomores. Coco’s caught off guard by his looks.
COCO
Cute...
(off Sofia’s jealous
glance)
...for a Black boy.
Troy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.
SOFIA
Hey boo. This is my friend Coco.
She’s new to the house.
TROY
Hey I’m Troy. Welcome to Armstrong
/ Parker, home of the dopest --
SOFIA
-- Are we on duty?
TROY
Head of House is always on duty.
COCO
Nice to meet you. I should get
settled. Thanks Sof!
Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down
the hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy’s ass.
TROY
Think I got time for a quick cut?
SOFIA
You got it cut last week.
TROY
It’s a Black thing babe.
SOFIA
Since when is OCD a Black thang?
TROY
Don’t say “thang” like that.
SOFIA
Besides you’ve got a shift at the
Politicos booth, then a shift at
Orientation, then your advisor --
9.
TROY
-- I’ll just wear a hat.
SOFIA
Then a movie maybe? Just us?
TROY
Election night. Babe, come on.
Sofia holds her tongue. Troy ignores this as he spots...
TROY (CONT’D)
Yo, Kurt my man.
14 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14
...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical
knowing glare. We recognize them from the “Pastiche” portrait
from before.
As they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt’s
glare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.
KURT
Sis.
Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of
his dismissal.
They both spot Sam’s “Missing: Black culture” flyers.
TROY
Is she kidding with this?
SOFIA
You don’t have to run again. Just
because it’s her doesn’t mean --
TROY
-- I can’t let Sam and her wannabe
Black Panthers take the House. The
House needs me. This is who I am.
SOFIA
It’s who he wants you to be.
Troy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.
TROY
Oh so you pick up a Psych class you
think you Freud or something? Huh?
SOFIA
A Freud reference. Sophisticated.
10.
TROY
(seducing)
Fine Beck, Jung, Maslow...
Troy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring
stacks of Sam’s “EBONY & IVY.” The booth is manned by REGGIE,
21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both
bohemian and radical.
Troy glares at Sam’s picture on the book. It’s on. There’s a
history between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie’s laptop we hear...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, this just in.
Dating a Black person to piss off
your parents is a form of racism.
Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.
REGGIE
Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in
shucking or was it jiving?
TROY
My major’s in Jive. Minoring in
Shuck. You’re still majoring in
trying to fuck my left overs right?
Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.
SOFIA
You need a shower.
15 INT. TROY’S BATHROOM - DAY 15
Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over
the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a
paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He
jots something down on a notepad as he whispers...
TROY
You went from ODB to Trey Songz...
16 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT 16
The hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black.
Helmut West watches from the back.
TROY
Artie, you know your success ratio
with the ladies went up like thirty
percent after I started edging you
up dog, come on. You went from ODB
to Trey Songz!
11.
The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone
except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro’d bohemian
disciples (who we’ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the
proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.
REGGIE
That’s his platform? Haircuts?
SAM
Oofta is as Oofta does.
Coco, sneaks through the door. She’s got the eyes of Helmut
on her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she
sits in the only open spot next to...
SAM (CONT’D)
Just because we’re colored don’t
mean we run on colored people time.
COCO
Boycotting hot combs don’t make you
an expert on “colored people” boo.
Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.
TROY
No but seriously, I care about you
guys. I care about this house. We
had a great year last year and if
it ain’t broke...
Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.
Sam doesn’t want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.
REGGIE
Just pretend like you’re in the
booth. Just you and the mic.
SAM
Hate this shit.
As Sam gets up and passes Troy --
TROY
You really think you can take this
from me?
SAM
Troy we live in a world where
there’s a Big Momma’s House 3. I
don’t have a chance in hell. Thank
God.
12.
Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy my brother, it’s broke.
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy’s a legacy kid. And yet it’s
under his watch that Armstrong /
Parker, the bastion of Black
culture here was gutted. By the
Randomization of Housing Act.
Second years of color no longer
have a say in where they go. The
culture that’s been fostered in
this house for two decades will be
wiped out in two years.
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --
SAM (CONT’D)
This wasn’t motivated by a desire
to mix things up. Bring about
racial and socioeconomic harmony.
No, the Black kids are sitting
together in the proverbial
cafeteria and they must be up to no
good.
Coco’s eyes are in the back of her head.
SAM (CONT’D)
We sit together to protect
ourselves. Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations,
political leanings, majors, you
name it. Black folks get their own
house, suddenly we got a problem?
Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam
delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.
SAM (CONT’D)
This Act doesn’t affect the other
houses like it does ours. There are
plenty of trustees, former coaches,
and presidents watching out for the
others. All we have is a Dean who’d
rather please his massa --
TROY
-- Yo that’s enough of that Sam --
13.
SAM
-- then stand up for his own. Look,
I know ya’ll ain’t voting for me.
Ya’ll ain’t ready and I didn’t come
here for that. The Black Student
Union and I have brought a petition
to repeal the Randomization of
Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
to the President and together we
can bring Black back to Manchester.
It’ll be by the door.
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy
- give her daps and all sorts of praise.
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with
neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.
MARTIN
I assume everyone has the app I
created by now?
REGGIE
(aside)
It’s a child’s app...
MARTIN
Good. Voting may commence.
Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view
as he punches something in.
Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who
give him a head nod. Troy’s got this. After a moment...
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Okay. Looks like we’ve got
ourselves a winner.
(devastated)
Sam White?
The blood drains from Sam’s face and Troy’s smile plummets
into the floor as the two turn to look at each other.
TROY & SAM
Oh shit.
Reggie’s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and
slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.
17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17
Right on the heels of Helmut’s exit is...
14.
COCO
So that’s what you’re looking for?
HELMUT
I’m looking for good TV sister.
COCO
I think I’d be good TV.
HELMUT
You’re at a great school, getting a
great education. Be good at that.
COCO
I am. And when I graduate early
with an Economics degree from
Manchester it will be the crowning
achievement of my Black middle
class parents’ ambitions.
HELMUT
Conflict is a commodity in my
industry. Sam’s got it. Do you?
COCO
So you want me to start a fight.
HELMUT
(exactly)
I don’t want you to do anything you
wouldn’t otherwise do.
Helmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.
He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.
18 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 18
A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while
the message plays over speaker phone.
SPEAKER
...bigger the dick the less you’ll
have to pay me to ssssuck it.
Dean Fairbank’s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Most everything’s locked up, but
we’ll find another residence to
move you to. Third time’s a charm.
(off Lionel’s sigh)
What about Armstrong / Parker?
15.
LIONEL
I don’t know...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I might have an opening. Maybe it’d
be good to be around...you know.
LIONEL
Dean. The worst thing about high
school, and believe me it was a
long list, were the Black kids.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Maybe it’s in your head. Sure,
sometimes our folks can be
intolerant around people like you.
Homo --
LIONEL
-- I don’t believe in labels.
Fairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank’s desk: Students
of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy
with the phrase “MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG” printed below.
Troy’s huge smile seems to mock him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You like jazz Lionel? Manchester’s
like jazz you know.
LIONEL
This is a research school.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And jazz is tension. The interplay
of improvised solos all creating
one song. Your problem is you’ve
got no instrument. No major, no
affiliations, no solo son.
LIONEL
I submit articles to the
Independent Observer.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
No one reads the Independent
Observer, my point is are you
playing swing or bebop?
LIONEL
You’re mixing metaphors.
16.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?
LIONEL
I hate jazz.
Fairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll do what I can. Not a word of
this in the Observer okay?
LIONEL
What’s it matter? No one reads it.
19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
to..
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
trades “No Homo’s” with the others.
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...
GEORGE
Lionel right?
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from
Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
George. We had Civ last semester?
How you doing?
LIONEL
Grood...Gate...I’m ah..
GEORGE
Fan of your stuff. In the Observer?
LIONEL
No one reads the Observer.
GEORGE
You seen this?
George hands Lionel Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyer.
17.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
The residents of Armstrong / Parker
just made her head of house. Am I
crazy or is there a there there?
LIONEL
What made you come over here?
George holds up Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy.” Lionel takes it.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean I’m glad you came --
GEORGE
-- My staff? God bless them.
They’re whiter than Michael
Jackson’s kids. We’re fucked if
anyone of them writes this story
and I will not let the transfers at
the Gazette do it first.
LIONEL
The oldest one has his face.
GEORGE
You’re in the Black Student Union.
You probably know Sam.
Lionel shakes his head “yes” and “no” at the same time.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
You come up with a good angle? I
want it in the Bugle.
Lionel eyes the bold “Bugle” logo on George’s shirt.
LIONEL
(aside)
Trumpet...
GEORGE
Bugle. Focus. The only paper on
campus with a national subscription
base and an Advisor from the New
York Times? Only so many ways a
person can distinguish themselves
at a place like this Lionel. You’re
good. You belong with us.
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we
know he’s never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn’t hurt there’s a handsome boy smiling at him either.
18.
20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their
opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall
between them.
TROY
Get it yet?
Sam shakes her head yes.
TROY (CONT’D)
Good. You’ve now got the shared
calendar, contacts, and official
email.
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack
of papers.
TROY (CONT’D)
Oh and before I forget.
SAM
Event requests for the year?
TROY
Just this month. They need your
approval. Also don’t forget to pick
your office hours. At least 20 per
week.
SAM
That’s absurd.
TROY
You’re in charge of a hundred
residents now. And they need time
to complain to your face. About
noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free
options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.
SAM
Troy. I didn’t think I was going to
win.
TROY
And by the way petitioning the
President on the Randomization of
Housing Act isn’t gonna do shit.
None of the other houses are
concerned.
19.
SAM
Because they all have a legacy of
rich and powerful allies on the
board who will make sure that
“random” works out to their
advantage.
TROY
And you think a petition is going
to change that?
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam’s
phone buzzes: “MOM.” The letters chill Sam to the core.
21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21
Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
with a notepad. He flips through Sam’s “EBONY & IVY” book...
SAM (V.O.)
The Armstrong / Parker dining hall
is the epicenter of Black culture
as it stands at Manchester. Only
here can you commiserate, celebrate
and discuss everything from Kanye
West lyrics to theoretical
relativism all in one sitting. Not
to mention find someone who can
actually do your hair.
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
lively and somewhat alien dining hall.
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
art major.
MARTIN
“We wuz robbed.” That election was
suspect man.
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.
SAM
You call me the minute there’s an
update. Love you too mom.
Sam hangs up. The call’s really put her in a bad place. She
sits at a table of her Bofros - who we’ll name by their hair.
20.
CURLS
There is one other sister in my
Relativity class, I’ll be damned if
our professor doesn’t call me
Laretta every God damn time.
DREADS
We all look the same.
REGGIE
Programming professor gets me and
Martin here mixed up constantly.
MARTIN
You should be so lucky.
Reggie glances over at Martin’s Mac Air.
REGGIE
Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?
Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
You still using your ID number?
SAM
I always forget passwords.
REGGIE
You are begging to get hacked.
SAM
Good thing the one evil technogenius
thinking like that is on my
side.
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.
SAM (CONT’D)
So this is what the revolution
looks like? Office hours and
paperwork.
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.
REGGIE
Winning was a happy accident. We
want the reform repealed right?
CURLS
Means to an end, sister.
21.
Sam feels the heat of her disciples’ eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.
COCO
The talented tenth always has to
bust its ass a little bit harder,
but I don’t see the benefit in
blaming white folks for everything.
CURLS
Who’s blaming?
TROY
I don’t see the issue. I never had
one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.
SAM
Lynch mob is still there. Just rebranded
itself.
TROY
As what pray tell?
REGGIE
The Republican party.
SAM
Want to know how this world sees
you? Go to a Young Republican’s
meeting and bring up Welfare.
SUNGMI
Or Immigration.
LIONEL
(aside)
Or gay equality.
KURT
Bullshit.
MARTIN
I agree. Got something to add?
KURT
The biggest athletes, movie stars,
hell your president is Black.
22.
(MORE)
Sometimes I think the hardest thing
to be in the American work force
right now is an educated white guy.
SUNGMI
You’re not serious.
KURT
You guys still got affirmative
action, you’re set.
REGGIE
This shit.
SAM
What are you doing in here?
KURT
Obama. Leader of the free world got
into Harvard on affirmative action.
Know who’s not president right now?
The guy that didn’t get in.
SAM
On behalf of the colored folks in
the room, let me apologize for all
the better qualified white students
whose place we’re taking up.
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.
SAM (CONT’D)
You get lost? Bechet is that way.
KURT
Yeah but what other dining hall
gives you chicken and waffles? Dear
White People right? Funny stuff.
How haven’t we staffed you yet?
SAM
On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor
magazine?
KURT
We’re a lot more than a magazine
sweetie. SNL staff is basically
half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just
like the network comedies.
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.
23.
KURT (CONT'D)
SAM
What gives you Clubhouse kids the
right to come to our Dining Hall?
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.
SAM (CONT’D)
You don’t live here.
MARTIN
Sam? What are you doing?
SAM
You can’t eat here.
Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.
TROY
Chill Sam damn. Let the man--
KURT & SAM
-- I got this.
KURT
Who are you to put me out?
SAM
(realizing)
I’m the Head of this house. And I’m
doing things my way.
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to
which Sam slams his tray to the ground.
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.
KURT
You got any idea who you’re --
SAM
-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.
The same one who’s been pushing to
break up this House for a decade.
What’s wrong? Is he scared letting
the Negroes gather in groups might
start a rebellion on the
plantation? You tell him from
me...he should be.
Kurt looks into Sam’s eyes and then his crew. They want out.
KURT
Bad move.
24.
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
snicker from Lionel which draws Sam’s eyes right to him.
Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
to GEORGE: “I’ve got the angle. I’m in.”
SAM
You too.
LIONEL
Me?
SAM
Is this your house?
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.
By the caution on Sam’s face it seems the first time she’s
ever heard this sound directed at her.
A slight envy boils in Coco.
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.
Locked out again.
23 INT. COCO’S ROOM - DAY 23
Coco scrolls Sam’s “Dear White People” Youtube page. 75K
Subscribers. She presses play on the latest video.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, stop dancing.
Two seconds. 600K views.
COCO
The fuck?
Coco exits and opens her own “TIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE” page. 2K
subscribers. Her latest video is at 10K views. Alright... She
presses record. Let’s the camera rest on her briefly...
COCO (CONT’D)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
(comes to mind)
So the other day, a girl had the
nerve to fix her mouth and ask me
if my hair was weaved.
(after a moment)
Weaved. Weaved bitch?
25.
(MORE)
First of all if you’re going to fix
your mouth to ask me something like
that, say it right please? It’s
weave. Noun. Present tense. Second
of all don’t assume just because
you see a sister with some hair
it’s a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a
bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out her own head I
wouldn’t have just overdrafted my
account paying for this shit but
that ain’t your business. Are those
your lips sweetie? Sweet heart is
that really your skin? These white
girls and these tans I swear to
God, they’re starting to look
darker than me.
Coco pauses it. Her mouse hovers over the check box next to
“private.” Instead she plays it back...and hits “publish.”
She clicks back through to Sam’s last video and hits “reply.”
As the red light on her computer’s web cam turns green...
COCO (CONT’D)
Dear White People. What do I think
about it?
24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24
Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam’s caller from
earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch...
...a Black and white 1920’s style silent movie, complete with
Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC.
SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN
A) OBAMA speaks at a debate
B) DIALOGUE CARD: “We are the change that we seek.”
C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit
D) DIALOGUE CARD: “HE’S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!”
E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in
white-face reacting. Until...
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM!
G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into
camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head.
26.
COCO (CONT’D)
H) Dialogue Card: “FIN”
PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a “seen it all before”
demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Does anyone have any comments
for Sam’s “Rebirth of a Nation?”
All of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT’D)
Gabe, go ahead.
GABE
I dig the “silent movie” thing, but
it’s a little self-congratulatory.
Light on story and frankly
thematically dubious.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Anybody else?
SAM
What?
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER
As students filter out of the class...
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Sam?
SAM
Before you say anything might I
remind you that I sat through Birth
of A Nation, Gone With The Wind,
and Tarantino week without protest.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
And might I remind you that I read
all fifteen pages of your
unsolicited essay on why Gremlins
is actually about suburban white
fear of Black culture.
SAM
The Gremlins are loud, talk in
slang, are addicted to fried
chicken and freak out when you get
their hair wet.
27.
PRESIDENT BODKIN
My only problem with your movie is
that it was late. The silent
projects were last semester Sam.
You were supposed to have emailed
your sound treatment over Summer.
SAM
I’ve been getting footage.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
This is your senior thesis Sam,
where the hell is your head at?
SAM
I’ve got Radio, BSU, this Head of
House thing --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Do you want this? Cause if not,
don’t waste my time here --
Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel.
SAM
-- Look this thing might as well be
my right hand Professor. I was busy
this summer that’s all.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
With everything but your major?
While your peers are taking
internships, making short films...
SAM
My dad. He’s sick. Had to go home.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
If you need some time off, take it.
But if you want to make it to next
semester --
SAM
-- I do --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Pull it together. This is
Manchester.
Sam wants this. It’s in her eyes as she holds her tongue.
25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25
Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys.
28.
SAM
Thematically dubious?
GABE
Well what was that supposed to be
about exactly?
SAM
You’re thematically dubious!
Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her.
SAM (CONT’D)
Since when do TA’s give critiques?
GABE
You invoke Minstrelsy for shock
value, but to what end?
SAM
To invoke the same feeling I get
when I turn on the TV and see some
so-called reality star shuck and
jive for ratings egged on by no
doubt white producers. Or the sassy
Black secretary with no backstory
or character development aside from
their skin color.
GABE
So it’s a tit for tat? *
EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY *
SAM *
You’re honestly saying that art *
can’t be reactionary? *
GABE *
You’re reacting to a work made *
almost a hundred years ago. *
SAM *
Yes because fear of Black men being *
involved in the United States *
Government is a completely *
antiquated concept. No social *
relevance whatsoever today. *
GABE *
Frankly I just think sometimes its *
better to hold a mirror up to your *
audience than to drop an *
ideological piano over their head. *
29.
SAM *
Frankly I just think works that *
deal with the African Diaspora *
through a post-modern lens are *
outright rejected unless they’re *
handled by a white artist. *
GABE *
African Diaspora? Really? *
26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26
The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs.
SAM
Blackface is alive and well in our
culture. Who primarily buys hip
hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta?
The same homogenized images of
Black people over and over again?
White people Gabe.
GABE
Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies?
SAM
We’re an underfed community. None
of this changes the fact that the
vibrancy, the complexity of Black
culture has been distilled into
commodities and marketing schemes
to be bought and sold--
GABE
--to the detriment of the so called
“real thing.” Got it.
And into a room...
INT. GABE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gabe slams the door.
SAM
I am indistinguishable from the so
called “urban” images used to amuse
and market to white America.
GABE
And the commodification of culture
is uniquely oppressive to Black
people?
30.
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans.
GABE (CONT’D)
So when Kanye raps about Louis V
and Rolexes and Classical Art,
exactly what exploited pocket of
Black America are those references
being mined from?
Sam can’t get her shirt off fast enough.
SAM
On your knees.
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy.
CUT TO BLACK.
27A INT. GABE’S ROOM - EVENING 27A
Sam’s eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips.
She’s surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the
outside spoon. They’re both naked. Her pompadour frayed.
GABE
What? You dream in “Cosby” again?
SAM
My hair was so straight. My sweater
so big. I told you about that?
Sam’s phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie’s photo pop
up. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn’t
answer. Silence as it hits her voicemail.
GABE
Hey so...this whole “Head of House”
thing. Congrats?
SAM
Yeah, it's…it's.
GABE
Weird, right? Never took you as a
student politician...
Reggie’s photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam’s eyes.
SAM
Yeah, well...
Sam rolls out of bed. Gabe thinks twice before he asks it.
31.
GABE
Sam? What are we doing?
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. Instead...
SAM
Fucking.
28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28
Reggie stares at Sam with stars in his eyes as she
effortlessly addresses the campus in between bits of jazz.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People. Please stop
touching my hair.
29 INT. GARMIN CLUB HOUSE - DAY 29
Lionel at an ancient oak dining room table listens to the
broadcast over his laptop. Makes studious notations...
SAM (V.O.)
Does this look like a petting zoo
to you?
Lionel gets an IM: “George: Hey handsome, how’s the story?”
To which Lionel writes: “Going great sexy.” Lionel deletes
“sexy” and replaces it with “:)” before hitting send.
29A BAR DIVIDE 29A
Across from Lionel is Kurt flanked by his eager but self
conscious right hand GORDON - and MITCH, swagged out varsity
crew captain and connoisseur of all things Black culture.
They wear “PASTICHE” gear, hunch over a glowing iPad and
scroll through a series of student group photos in the
Yearbook. Kurt stares off into space, turns up the GANGSTA
RAP playing from a nearby blue tooth speaker.
Kurt pours shots of Jack which Gordon eyes with caution.
GORDON
Kurt it’s three.
MITCH
Y.O.L.O. my nigga!
Everyone takes the shot.
32.
GORDON
We don’t even have our new staff
yet. Why are we planning this?
KURT
Everyone wants to be on our staff
that’s the easy part.
MITCH
We’re going to make staff bids on
Game Night, and the RSVP’s are
through the roof for that.
KURT
Yeah but Halloween is our premiere
party. The waitlist is already a
hundred deep and it’s going to take
a lot to outdo this summer.
MITCH
Cinco de Mayo was epic.
INSERT:
A black and white photo of Kurt and crew dressed in Sombreros
and Mexican stereotypes at a wild pool party. The title
reads... PASTICHE PRESENTS “WETBACK”
GORDON
How about the Young Republicans?
KURT
Too close to the Tea-Party.
INSERT:
Photo of Kurt and crew dressed as famous female political
conservatives - brandishing rally signs with misspellings and
cups of tea. The title reads... “PASTICHE’S TEA PARTY”
MITCH
Yo we need an East vs West hip hop
party. Get the honeys in here.
GORDON
“The honeys?” You’re from Vermont.
KURT
Guys what’s the Pastiche motto?
GORDON
“Sharpen thy sword.”
33.
MITCH
Our motto is a euphemism for
masturbation?
GORDON
It’s a reminder that satire is the
weapon of reason. So who on campus
is being unreasonable?
MITCH
Sounds like a reminder of how gay
you are.
GORDON
Was that even a reasonable attempt
at a quip Mitch?
MITCH
Hey Gordon, say reasonable again.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, knowing Lil’
Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an
Honorary Black Card. It just
reminds me how often you say the
word “nigga” when no one Black is
around as is required in reciting
said lyrics.
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs
headphones into his computer and looks down.
KURT
The hell does Sam think she is?
MITCH
Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a
pissed off baby.
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they’re leaning
towards the same idea.
KURT
Could we?
GORDON
How?
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.
KURT
Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean
today.
34.
(MORE)
We had a very enlightening
conversation. I just want to say...
I’m sorry about the voice message.
29B DINING ROOM 29B
Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel’s table. Kurt unzips
his pants silently.
KURT (CONT’D)
Do you accept?
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he
starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly
looks in the other direction. Kurt’s friends crack up.
GORDON
Please put that away.
KURT
You got to talk to these people in
a language they’ll understand.
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro.
LIONEL
Pathetic.
KURT
(yelling)
Wherever he ships you off to, be
sure to pack a sense of humor with
you, kay bro?
Lionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy”
book to a section called...
SAM (V.O.)
The Paper Bag Tests.
As Lionel reads we swish pan to...
30 DREAM DINER 30
...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST
SAM
The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly’s
for a snack. Your waitress mistakes
you for someone who looks like you
(Black) who once ran up a thirty
dollar bill and left a dollar tip.
35.
KURT (CONT'D)
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us.
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him.
SAM (CONT’D)
You watch all the other customers
order before you do...
Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel.
LIONEL
Pastrami sandwich on rye.
SAM
...then proceed to wait no less
than forty minutes for your food.
A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come.
SAM (CONT’D)
How do you tip? A...
LIONEL
Forty minutes? Man she’s lucky I
leave her forty cents. You do a
good job, maybe you’ll see a tip.
SAM
B...
LIONEL
Doris was tripping, but fifteen
percent is the least I can do.
SAM
Or C...
LIONEL
I reject the stereotype that
African American’s don’t tip. I’m
leaving her twenty, no twenty five,
just to prove I can!
CUT TO:
Lionel’s back in reality. He ponders the scenario.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
C?
He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on
the bottom of the page. “A) ONE HUNDRED” “B) OOFTA” and his
answer “C) NOSE-JOB.”
36.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Nose-job?
31 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 31
The campus has settled into the semester as students trudge
back and forth to class.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People in a shocking
reversal using the term “African
American” is borderline racist now.
32 INT. DEAN FAIRBANKS OFFICE - DAY 32
Dean Fairbanks and PRESIDENT HERBERT FLETCHER, 50’s in an
even better suit than Fairbanks listen to the radio.
Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two.
SAM (O.S.)
Turns out if you’re too worried
about Political Correctness to say
“Black”, odds are you secretly just
want to call us niggers anyway and
truth be told I’d rather you just
be honest about it.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Free speech my ass.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Stalin quotes for two hundred?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
You’re joking about this?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sorry, was I supposed to take
“Free speech my ass” as a
legitimate suggestion?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
This is your office’s issue Walter.
Especially after that episode with
Kurt in the dining hall.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Every race issue is my issue.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
It’s a student issue. You are the
Dean of students aren’t you?
The two share an old and heated glare.
37.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
The Times has been watching us like
a hawk. Last thing we need is some
“race war” on newspapers across the
country. How do you think our donor
base will feel about that? Our fundraiser
is four weeks away.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
How bad is this deficit of yours?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Worse. But let me tell you
something. If this blows up any
further? It’s on you Walter. Racism
is over in America. And if anyone’s
still dealing with it, it’s the --
I don’t know Mexicans probably.
Troy pokes his head in. Fairbanks cuts the radio off.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Come on in.
TROY
President Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Son, call me Herb.
Fairbanks grits his teeth as Fletcher exits and Troy sits.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
President Fletcher tells me his son
got his ass handed to him.
Troy hates this game.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Bout time. Can’t tell you how many
instances I had to defend Armstrong
/ Parker when I was Head of House.
TROY
Sam’s out of line. Kurt’s alright.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you’re supposed to be better
than alright. Since when do we lose
elections Troy?
TROY
The Housing Act passing without a
fight didn’t help.
38.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What have I told you about excuses?
TROY
Pops my course load is full anyway.
I’m head of Econ Board, I’m
thinking about Pastiche.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Pastiche? On Kurt Fletcher’s staff?
TROY
You know to round out the res?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll be God damned if twenty years
from now you have to end up working
for that dumb asses son.
TROY
(put in his place)
Yes sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Fletcher and I graduated a year
apart. He barely made it through. I
graduated Summa cum Laude. Now look
who’s President and who’s Dean.
TROY
What’s the difference?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
A couple hundred grand a year.
Understand what I’m saying? Now
what happened between you and Sam
to make her come after you anyway?
TROY
Sofia. You remember Sofia? Daughter
of the President. Psych major. “Has
the world ahead of her Troy.”
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t like your tone boy.
TROY
Sorry sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
So you lost the House. On to the
school presidency then.
The light in Troy’s eyes dims a bit.
39.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
It’ll be good to show this campus
is capable of electing someone like
you as school president.
TROY
Someone like me?
33 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 33
Troy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower
runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet
apparatus. He jots down on a notepad and LAUGHS to himself.
TROY’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME
Sofia has her face to the floor - peering underneath the
bathroom door. She can see Troy’s feet. What the hell?
Off the SQUEAK of the shower being cut Sofia jumps up.
MOMENTS LATER
Troy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. Sofia on the
couch pretends to have been watching television.
TROY
Babe. Hat or no hat?
Troy stands before her in his undies holding a Kangol. He
eyes her oversized T-shirt.
TROY (CONT’D)
Are you wearing that?
SOFIA
I don’t have to be.
Sofia yanks Troy to her by his underwear to kiss his navel.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
Hey boo...why don’t we put some of
your new found free time to good
use? It’s been a while since...
TROY
What’s with all this boo stuff?
SOFIA
...since you fucked me with your
big Black cock.
Troy pulls away.
40.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
It used to turn you on when I
talked like that. Is it me?
TROY
(yes)
I love you.
SOFIA
Is it Sam?
TROY
Can we please just, get ready?
SOFIA
Why? I hate my brother’s friends.
Troy thinks over his next words carefully.
TROY
You’re not going to go with me?
SOFIA
You’d go without me?
Troy tries to flash a charming shrug.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
You’re my guest!
Sofia gathers some books and heads for the door.
TROY
You can hang out while I’m --
SOFIA
-- Okay, what’s with you and my
brother? Are you in love with him?
Is this like, some DL shit?
Sofia storms out.
TROY
“DL shit!?”
34 INT. FOREST - NIGHT 34
Lionel walks up the darkly lit stairs of a very old building.
He reaches a door marked “Newsroom.”
35 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 35
Lionel looks around the dimmed office. There is music and
light coming from a room past all the cubicles...
41.
36 INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 36
...An office filled with computers. George and a few other
EDITORS scream with laughter - beers and pizza in hand.
GEORGE does a beat on his desk while...
GEORGE
I keeps it clean
Ya know what I mean.
I drinks my Vodka straight,
like I’m a fiend.
ANNIE, a strawberry blonde laughs in George’s lap. Lionel’s
envy shows.
ANNIE
Wait, quiet I want to hear this.
Annie turns up a Youtube video of...
COCO (O.S.)
If I could grow straight Indian
hair out my head --
ANNIE
Ohmigod, this is going on Facebook.
Annie swivels in her chair only to SCREAM BLOODY MURDER at
the sight of Lionel.
LIONEL
Relax the Negro at the door is not
here to rape you.
Annie laughs. The mood is drunk and light.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
So this is what editors do?
GEORGE
We’re taking a break, what are you
doing here?
LIONEL
You wanted me to drop in and tell
you how the story was coming?
GEORGE
Yeah like this week. It’s Saturday
night. You got nowhere else to be?
LIONEL
It was this or the new Madea movie.
42.
GEORGE
Dear God. Where does Madea go this
time? Dialysis?
37 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 37
Sam, flanked by Reggie and the BoFros are in mid rant.
REGGIE
Man fuck Tyler Perry.
SAM
Like, can we have a movie with, you
know characters in them? ‘Stead of
stereotypes wrapped in Christian
dogma?
REGGIE
Why is every educated person
inherently evil? Why this Nigga
gotta be in a mutha fucking dress
all the mutha fucking time?
SAM
How come the only Black movies
Hollywood wants to make are ones
with mammies in fat suits or Black
women in pain man?
All of this is directed at a TEENAGER in the box office.
TEENAGER
Most people are here to see Fang 9.
(after a beat)
Kelly Rowland’s in it?
The group throw up their hands and groan in protest.
38 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 38
Game Night and Kurt’s house is filled with smoke, music, and
rich kids who play cards at various tables.
Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. A
few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. This
perks her up, as she arches her back slightly...
...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER
GIRL who has entered behind her.
Coco catches herself in the mirror. What don’t they see?
38A CARD TABLE 38A
43.
Troy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy
holds court - much to Kurt’s chagrin. The mood is playful.
There’s a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco.
39 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
A huge “Boycott Sal’s Pizzeria” poster hangs on the walls of
Sam’s chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros
and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about.
Underground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint
coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on “SCHOOL DAZE” which
plays on her 36’ flatscreen.
SAM
How ‘bout you stop stereotyping
yourself and put that shit out?
This ain’t “Friday.”
REGGIE
Yo Sam. We got to talk about the
protest. When are we are bringing
the Housing fight to the prez?
Sungmi takes a seat next to Sam. Some kids hop up and start
grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist.
SUNGMI
The House voted down sponsoring the
rally.
REGGIE
What do we need it sponsored for?
SAM
Demonstrations can get shut down if
a House doesn’t sponsor them.
REGGIE
Like the House you’re head of?
Sam shoots Reggie a glare. He backs off.
SUNGMI
Hey Sam, I read “Ebony and Ivy.”
What’s with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs,
One Hundred stuff? I miss
something?
Sam smiles.
SAM
You want me to break it down?
44.
40 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 40
Troy deals another hand with Kurt, Mitch and Gordon. Troy’s
homeboy swag is thicker than usual.
MITCH
Yo my perfect Friday night is
whiskey and my T-Bone Walker
records, real talk.
TROY
Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker?
40A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 40A
SAM
Only a few ways colored folks
survive at a place like this.
MITCH
Uh only a pioneer of electric and
jump blues bro. Know your roots.
TROY
White folks always be on stuff like
decades too late and act like they
discovered some shit.
SAM
“Oofta” is the jazz age term for
Bojangle types who Blacked it up
for White audiences.
MITCH
Don’t sleep on T-Bone man.
TROY
Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu
got on right now?
MITCH
Public Enemy my Nig--
TROY
--Yo watch that man.
GORDON
You just called him --
TROY
-- Ya’ll get Country Clubs we get
to say Nigga.
Everyone at the table erupts in laughter. Except Kurt.
45.
GORDON
And golf? And all our girls?
TROY
Whatchu mean all your girls?
GORDON
Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley
Snipes and uh, Troy over here...
TROY
Yo. It’s a word for that.
Reparations.
More Kurt-less laughter from the table.
TROY (CONT’D)
Forty white bitches and a mule.
Perfectly executed. Troy grins as the table erupts.
SAM
An Oofta modulates his Blackness up
or down depending on the crowd and
what he wants from them.
MITCH
Kurt?
KURT
What?
GORDON
Kurt.
Troy watches this exchange closely.
GORDON (CONT’D)
Troy. You thinking about Pastiche?
TROY
That’s the magazine right?
GORDON
For starters.
MITCH
What other “magazine” you know has
a first look deal at NBC? The third
biggest Youtube channel. Talk show.
Platinum comedy record homie!
46.
GORDON
Couldn’t you see him on the talk
show Kurt?
Kurt looks at his cards.
KURT
I fold.
41 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 41
A small crowd’s formed around Sam.
SUNGMI
Okay, and a nose-job is a wannabe?
42 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 42
Coco finishes her drink and catches Mitch and Gordon as they
start up a Youtube video on their iPad. The previous game is
over. They watch “Dear White People - 1,378,480 views.”
42A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 42A
SAM
Sort of. Nose-jobs smooth their
Black edges and try to blend.
Coco runs her fingers through her straight hair.
GORDON
You seen this one?
SAM (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People using Instagram.
You have an iPhone and go on hikes.
I get it.
COCO
Ugh.
Gordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco. Mitch eyes her curves.
GORDON
Not a fan?
Coco makes a “no” face.
MITCH
Sup ma?
COCO
Don’t talk like that.
47.
GORDON
Hey I know you...
Coco is taken aback as Gordon punches up her video and plays
it back. She hovers over them.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
Coco a bit embarrassed scans the view count.
SAM
A Nose-job’s worst fear is that
their “Blackness” might cause a
fuss or draw undue attention so
they apologize for it or use it to
self deprecate.
COCO
Forty thousand views already?
GORDON
Looks like someone submitted you to
Buzzfeed. Taking off...
Coco leans over them and scrolls down. The first comment is
from a HELMUT: “Much better...” Coco soaks this in.
MITCH
You wan’ a drink a sun’in?
COCO
Let me guess you’re from Ohio?
MITCH
Vermont.
GORDON
What do you have against Dear White
People?
Coco smiles and slyly clicks to her next video.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People. How do I feel
about it? Well for one it’s Blacker
than thou propaganda from a bougie
Lisa Bonet wannabe who smells like
patchouli and frankly I can’t
believe we’re letting Sam get away
with it.
48.
Mitch and Gordon’s mouths are ajar. Coco studies the view
count...26,758. A pride strikes Coco.
43 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 43
As the impromptu party dies down...
SUNGMI
Okay and One Hundred?
REGGIE
Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black
as hell just cause.
Sam rolls her eyes.
SUNGMI
But what about just being you?
SAM
Like I said...
44 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 44
Lionel’s got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie’s really
warmed to him - her hands play with his afro.
ANNIE
You don’t mind do you?
SAM (V.O.)
There’s only a few ways a person of
a color can survive at a place like
this...
LIONEL
Of course not.
GEORGE
Alright so then what?
LIONEL
So then Sam says “What, is your
daddy scared the Negroes are gonna
start a rebellion on the
plantation?”
George goes CRAZY at this.
GEORGE
To Kurt Fletcher!?
LIONEL
Yeah. Yes. Yup.
49.
GEORGE
We’ve got a news item but there’s
something bigger here. It’s a
profile piece on Armstrong / Parker
and Sam White’s pseudo revolution.
ANNIE
What’s the headline?
LIONEL
Outdated nationalist seeks purpose
starts race war?
Lionel’s joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it.
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES
before Lionel briefly.
GEORGE
Beers in the corner. Bang out the
news item tonight and we’ll work on
the profile piece for next week.
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open
computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and
Annie stare at Lionel expectantly.
LIONEL
What are you doing?
ANNIE
All Bugle staffer must freestyle.
It’s law.
GEORGE
You want to be a staffer right?
LIONEL
(awkward)
My name is Lionel
Kind of like a lion
King of the jungle
Indigenous to Africa...
The beat has long since stopped.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Sorry.
45 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 45
Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out.
50.
TROY
Yo man, you know I wasn’t talking
about Sof back there with whole
forty bitches thing. I was just --
KURT
-- trying to get on my staff?
TROY
I never really thought about --
KURT
-- Bullshit. Game Night is where we
make our bids for the new staff.
It’s why everyone’s here. You were
practically about to bust out a tap
dance.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man. I just
came to hang out.
KURT
My staff likes you. A lot.
TROY
But you don’t.
KURT
This thing with you and Sof...
TROY
I’m good to her.
KURT
Our dad’s have been playing a game
of chess off and on since 1972.
TROY
What and Sof is the White queen?
KURT
You’re a pawn. And I think it’s
time you get off the board bro.
Troy takes this in.
KURT (CONT’D)
Here’s the deal. Every year we
throw a party. The point is to mock
the self important and moronic
entities of the campus. The way to
get staffed is to write an invite
for the party.
51.
(MORE)
Our invites are legendary, we make
Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs
every year. If your invite is the
one that goes out, you’re
guaranteed a spot on the staff. The
runners up are voted on by the rest
of us.
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance.
45A LIVING ROOM 45A
Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. She’s in her
element with these boys at her feet.
COCO
I just think having good hair and
carrying on with a degree of
sophistication doesn’t make me a
traitor to the race.
MITCH
Want to know why they used to call
me Black Mitch?
GORDON
Absolutely not.
COCO
No one called you that.
KITCHEN
Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach...
TROY
Okay. And what’s this year’s theme?
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively.
KURT
Still working on that...
TROY
The party’s a couple weeks away.
GORDON
Yo Kurt. I want you to meet
someone.
COCO
You guys got a party coming up?
Coco smiles at Kurt, before flicking her eyes over Troy.
52.
KURT (CONT’D)
46 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 46
Sungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam’s apartment as
the party winds down.
SUNGMI
Hey, about the rally. You could
still get the permit anyway Sam and
go against the board. Most people
consider that political suicide
though.
REGGIE
We got to rally Sam. Time is now.
SAM
Use your head Reggie. You think a
rally is going to change things?
REGGIE
It’ll do a hell of a lot more than
a radio show or views on Youtube.
Everyone gets quiet. Sungmi takes this time to exit.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Look, we got power Sam and it’s
time we used it. We earned it.
SAM
We? I didn’t see you running for
shit Reggie.
The Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. Sam waits a beat
and rolls her eyes.
47 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT 47
Sam walks after Reggie.
REGGIE
Tired.
SAM
Don’t “one word” me.
REGGIE
Why you got to snap at me all the
time? I’m around you like twenty
four seven. Like your lap dog. I
don’t even usually get down like
that with no red bone chicks man.
53.
SAM
Don’t call me that.
REGGIE
Come on, I thought your ass was
Puerto Rican when I met you.
Sam turns to go.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Oh so you can dish it out but you
can’t take it?
SAM
I’m taking my ass home.
REGGIE
Come on Sam. You know how I feel
about you.
SAM
How am I supposed to know how you
feel about me?
REGGIE
You know what? Forgive me if I see
something in you. Something
inspiring. Something folks like me
can get behind.
Reggie puts his hands on Sam’s belt and pulls her in to a
kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie’s shoulder Sam sees...
...Gabe look back at her. He’s heartbroken. She pretends not
to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Tell me you’ll set up the rally.
SAM
I’ll set up the rally.
48 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 48
Kurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances.
GORDON
Are we sure about this?
KURT
It’s ironic. Bold. And don’t tell
me I’m the only one who thinks Sam
White’s little movement needs to
get cut down to size.
54.
Agreement Coco’s gaze. Uncertainty in Troy’s.
KURT (CONT’D)
Looks like you got your Hip Hop
party Mitch.
MITCH
‘Bout time. It’s going to be huge
man, fucking epic.
Kurt holds back a smile.
KURT
Boys, we’ve got a lot more mingling
to do. We’ll be in touch. And Troy?
Get off the board bro.
Troy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. Troy smiles,
goes to exit.
TROY
Nice seeing you.
COCO
Where’s Sofia?
TROY
I have no idea.
COCO
Trouble in paradise?
Troy shrugs and heads to the party.
COCO (CONT’D)
Figures.
(off Troy’s
incredulousness)
Nothing. I’m sure you’ve got
something else fair and petite
and...fair lined up for that drink.
TROY
What’s that supposed to mean?
COCO
It’s fine. I’m not even really into
Black dudes anyway.
TROY
I’ll have you know I’m an equal
opportunity employer, okay?
55.
COCO
And what kind of jobs are you
hiring for mister?
Coco’s stiletto rubs the side of Troy’s calf.
TROY
Aren’t you and Sofia --
COCO
-- I’m an accessory to Sofia. Can’t
ever shake the feeling I’m an
assignment for that Afro Studies
Minor of hers.
Troy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards
this dangerous and tempting creature before him.
COCO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you have no idea what I
mean.
49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49
Lionel and George walk through the campus at night. George
waves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House.
LIONEL
She seems really cool.
George just smiles.
GEORGE
Did we go too far? You’re in
Armstrong/Parker right?
LIONEL
No. Garmin.
GEORGE
Fancy.
LIONEL
George I’m not exactly down with
Sam and I’m not in the BSU. I got
kicked out of Armstrong / Parker
same as Kurt. But I’m going to
write a good story, okay?
GEORGE
I hope so. I want a Bugle on your
chest by the end of the month.
Lionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest.
56.
They reach the front of Lionel’s house. George runs his hand
through Lionel’s hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some
other kids - trade glances.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Your fro’s so gnarly.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
GEORGE
Night Lionel.
Lionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of
Mitch and company.
MITCH
Party’s not over.
LIONEL
I live here.
MITCH
Sorry bro. Invitation only.
LIONEL
It’s two in the morning.
Mitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.
Lionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He
scrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.
Starts an email.
50 INT. TROY’S BEDROOM - MORNING 50
Troy’s Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and
besides a bright pink thong.
Coco’s pink painted finger nails travel through the creases
of Troy’s immaculate abs.
TROY
Coco huh?
COCO
Colandrea doesn’t exactly pass the
resume test, you know? I mean
couldn’t you fucking die? My
parents should’ve just named me
Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do
you...indulge?
Coco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.
57.
TROY
It’s ten am.
Coco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
I don’t mess with that stuff.
Coco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.
COCO
Sure about that?
TROY
Sure you don’t like Black guys?
COCO
Girl like me is just a placeholder
for ya’ll at a place like this.
TROY
I’m not like that.
COCO
I don’t think Sam would agree.
TROY
That was different.
COCO
No it wasn’t. Poor thing, she was
light skin-ded and everything.
TROY
Yo, it wasn’t like that alright?
Troy’s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy’s.
TROY (CONT’D)
My pops. He wanted me with
Fletcher’s daughter. They’ve been
in competition ever since they went
here. Pops hates that Fletcher
ended up President and he got stuck
as the Dean.
COCO
So your upbringing may have
actually fucked you up more than
mine? That’s hot.
Troy laughs and takes the joint back.
58.
COCO (CONT’D)
The hell is the difference between
a Dean and a President anyway?
TROY
Apparently four hundred years of
unreconciled oppression.
COCO
He’s not going to like you running
with the Pastiche boys is he?
TROY
If I even get tapped.
COCO
You will. And you should do it.
They all land somewhere big, some
before they even graduate. I’ve
seen you in front of a crowd Troy.
I bet you could be famous.
TROY
That what you want? To be famous?
COCO
I want people to know my name.
TROY
Which one?
Coco’s phone buzzes with a message. It’s Kurt.
COCO
(reading)
We want you. Come by Ellington
tomorrow at eight.
(to Troy)
Anything?
Troy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy’s
eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.
COCO (CONT’D)
You’re going to have to stand up to
him sooner or later Troy.
52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52
Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation
marks her pretty face.
SOFIA
You said you loved me.
59.
TROY
I like you a lot.
Salt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.
SOFIA
What do you do in the bathroom?
When you leave the shower running?
Was it just to get away from me?
Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess.
TROY
I smoke weed and write jokes.
Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...
...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
Troy turns to enter the house.
53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53
Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other’s gaze.
As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
they’re headed in the same direction.
53A UPSTAIRS 53A
Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
with a key. Troy’s already at the door when he looks up and
realizes Lionel’s just entered his apartment.
54 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54
TROY
The hell are you doing?
LIONEL & TROY
This is my apartment.
TROY
The hell it is.
LIONEL
The Dean said it was the only
opening.
TROY
Head of House doesn’t share.
60.
LIONEL
But you’re not Head of House.
Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
leaving Lionel alone in the living room.
57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57
Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.
DREADS
Stay Black, my brother.
LIONEL
Sure thing?
Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
entrance - suddenly chums. Troy’s getting good news and
gladly shakes Kurt’s hand.
KURT
Need your submission by Thursday.
TROY
You got it bro.
The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.
KURT
The fuck?
Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.
TROY
Yo!
Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.
Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
briefly who shares the same smirk.
He realizes Sam’s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.
REGGIE
Finally made it in.
61.
DREADS
Been moved around a lot right?
CURLS
You must have been terrified when
you saw “Armstrong/Parker” written
on your moving assignment.
LIONEL
I was just finishing up.
REGGIE
Do Black people scare you?
LIONEL
(realizing its true)
No.
REGGIE
You’re too scared to even ask
anyone for a cut.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
DREADS
No. I’m growing it out. You’re
fostering an ecosystem.
REGGIE
How come you don’t come to BSU?
LIONEL
I listen to Mumford and Sons and
watch Robert Altman movies. You
honestly think I’m Black enough for
the union?
DREADS
Yo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha
fucka goes in.
CURLS
(after a beat)
We’re not all homophobes you know.
Black folks?
Lionel’s eyes dart around. How did she know?
DREADS
I’m bumping Frank Ocean right now.
I don’t give a fuck. Imma still eat
at Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets
good as hell.
62.
LIONEL
I’m late for class.
REGGIE
You’re the “Black voice” of the
Bugle now. We’re just trying to
decide if you are friend or foe.
Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.
Sam’s on the front page with the headline “WHITE STUDENTS
TOLD TO ‘GET OUT’ BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
REGGIE (CONT’D)
We got to protect our girl.
Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over
something with Martin at another table.
LIONEL
I’m not on staff. Not until I make
good on my assignment, I’m just --
REGGIE
-- Assignment? What’s the story?
LIONEL
They want me to do a profile piece
on Black culture at Manchester.
REGGIE
Of which you are so clearly an
expert.
Shame floods Lionel’s face.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
So what’s harder man? Being Black
enough for the Black kids or the
white ones?
LIONEL
Being neither.
Another GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This
time it’s for...
...Gabe, who’s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...
GABE
Sam! Really Sam?
She just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.
63.
58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58
Professor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students
fill in essay questions. Sam’s eyes are glued to a window...
Outside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and
start pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.
Sam’s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch
the time.
59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A
Sam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.
From behind her...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Running late.
Sam pauses and turns to see him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
For your little rally?
SAM
Forget your sign Dean?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you honestly think this is in
the spirit of Armstrong / Parker
house?
SAM
The role of the counter culture is
to wake up the mainstream to --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- I’ve got furniture older than
you. Counter culture? Is that what
you think this is? That show of
yours?
SAM
What about my show?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your show is racist.
SAM
Black people can’t be racist.
The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.
64.
SAM (CONT’D)
Prejudice? Yes. But not racist.
Racism describes a system of
disadvantage based on race. Black
people can’t be racist since they
don’t benefit from such a system.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you read the school papers?
SAM
Is the New York Times a school
paper?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your antics are making press Sam
and press like this keeps men like
President Fletcher up at night.
SAM
Warm milk?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
He’s building a file on you.
SAM
It’s not my fault your son couldn’t
beat me in an election.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sure it was hard growing up.
Wondering which side you fit into.
Feeling like you have to
overcompensate perhaps?
SAM
If that’s true, I’m not the only
one Dean.
Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank’s last words resonate
more than she’d like.
Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.
59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B
Huge canvas signs with the words “WHITES ONLY” are strewn
about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.
Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the
SUV.
65.
REGGIE
There you are! We supposed to start
at noon.
SAM
I told you I had class.
There’s a vibration in Sam’s pocket. Her phone says “MOM.”
She cuts it off and picks up a “white’s only” sign.
REGGIE
Those are going up on Gillespie.
Good right?
Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it’s too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Yo. What’s that? You’re not getting
cold feet are you?
SAM
No. I mean how long do I have to
talk anyway?
REGGIE
You’re kidding right? You’re sort
of the keynote.
SAM
Yeah but...you know I think the
whole Malcolm X thing is your lane
Reg. I’m just not --
REGGIE
-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab
a bullhorn. Turn it on.
Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: “IT’S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME”
Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who’s just happened upon the parking lot.
GABE
What is all this?
SAM
(on phone)
Hey. In the middle of--
-- Okay. Okay. Okay.
66.
Tears well up in Sam’s eyes as she shakes her head no and
heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.
When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
look of indignation asks her what she’s doing.
REGGIE
Sam?
Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie’s
heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Sam!
60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60
Reggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam’s door.
REGGIE
Yo, what the hell Sam?
61 INT. SAM’S ROOM - DAY 61
The banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The
tears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.
GABE
You want me to tell them to go?
SAM
You’re so tough.
GABE
I will.
SAM
I want you to wait until they’ve
gone and then head home.
GABE
I’m trying to be here for you.
SAM
Can you be somewhere else for me?
61A HALLWAY 61A
REGGIE
Sam! I know you’re home.
67.
61B SAM’S ROOM 61B
GABE
What do you see in him?
SAM
The only eligible single brother on
campus.
GABE
Wow. Okay.
SAM
I get it. Your parents owned in
Harlem or something? You watched
“Do The Right Thing” in high school
and you want to prove to the world
you’re down?
GABE
I want to be down? How long does it
take to get your hair like that?
REGGIE (O.S.)
Sam. We want to talk.
SAM
Reggie I will call you later damn!
(to Gabe)
You don’t know what you’re talking
about. Girls like me--
GABE
--what? Have to pick a side? I’m
sick of your tragic Mulatto
bullshit Sam!
SAM
You can’t say Mulatto.
GABE
Mulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!
MORE BANGING
SAM
Window. Go out the window.
GABE
I’m sorry if I can’t be your Nubian
prince on my Black horse ready to
take you back to fucking Zamunda!
68.
SAM
That’s not a real African country.
GABE
Can I please get some credit for a
solid “Coming to America”
reference?
Sam tries not laugh at this.
GABE (CONT’D)
This isn’t you Sam.
SAM
No? And who am I?
GABE
You’re this...girl...
SAM
Perceptive.
GABE
Who...likes to argue with me about
every fucking thing. And I hate it
because we both know you’re smarter
than me. Your favorite director is
Bergman, but you tell people its
Spike Lee. You love bebop, but
you’ve got a thing for Taylor
Swift. I know because my Mac picks
up your Mac’s library.
SAM
And I was so careful...
GABE
You like to use phrases from the
thirties and wear clothes from the
fifties and hairstyles from the
sixties. You like to watch me when
you think I’m sleeping. And trace
the outlines of my face.
Sam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.
GABE (CONT’D)
You’re more “Banksy” than “Barack”
but you’ve been co-opted as some
sort of revolutionary leader or
something? But really you’re an
anarchist. A beautiful writer,
artist, filmmaker, shit starter.
And beautiful, in general.
69.
Sam’s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: “Mom.”
SAM
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. It’s okay. Get
some sleep.
Sam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE
from Sam as she let’s go of the tension she’d been holding.
GABE
Everything okay?
SAM
(happy tears)
His condition’s stable.
GABE
Good. That’s good Sam.
Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.
SAM
Gabe!
Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...
GABE
What!?
...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down
the heartbroken looks on her disciples’ faces.
SAM
I’m sorry.
And with that she closes the door right on Reggie.
62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62
Coco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing
terrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee’s.
HELMUT
New videos are picking up steam.
COCO
Told you I was good TV.
HELMUT
The show I’m scouting for... It’s
called Black Face / White Place.
It’s reality. Like a “True Life.”
Each episode centers on a different
one of “us” in a sea of “them.”
70.
COCO
Interesting.
HELMUT
Interesting? You think they want
interesting? Dignified stories of
triumph and survival?
(off Coco’s naive shrug)
They want the “authentic urban
experience” which is basically
network talk for bitching and weave
snatching. I’m telling you this
because the network is looking to
take one of the subjects to series.
I got one episode. One shot to find
that subject. So if we do this...
COCO
...we do it all the way. I’m
guessing Sam turned you down.
HELMUT
I think so. She called me a
Bojangling Oofta, whatever that
means. Everything else she said
would’ve been bleeped on tv.
(off Coco’s laugh)
So look, forty thousand hits on
Youtube is good. It’s not great.
COCO
I’m about to get a whole lot more.
63 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - DAY 63
Coco sits before a video camera. The room is dim.
KURT
We don’t have anyone like you on
staff and you had a great idea. We
brought you here to --
COCO
-- I want to MC it. Your party.
KURT
We’re here to tell you what we
want.
COCO
You want me and in order to get me,
you have to let me MC.
71.
(MORE)
And I want to do a live video blog
from my Youtube account.
BACK TO:
64 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 64
HELMUT
They’d let you do that?
COCO
They got no choice. They need me --
BACK TO:
65 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65
COCO
-- cause without me ya’ll look like
a bunch of privileged assholes.
KURT
We don’t let people video blog our
events...
COCO
...You got a week to put this thing
together boo boo. What’s it going
to be?
CUT TO:
66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66
Helmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye.
COCO
You look surprised.
HELMUT
It’s just...
67 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67
Troy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in
their rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. They
each look at the other in alternate intervals.
HELMUT (V.O.)
...not everyone is as camera ready
as you.
67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A
72.
COCO (CONT'D)
Lionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on
his TV and heads to...
67B KITCHEN 67B
...bar divide. Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy’s
room. He’s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels
Lionel’s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.
67C TROY’S ROOM 67C
Troy types in “KURT FLETCHER” in the “To” field and “PASTICHE
SUBMISSION” in the subject field. He hits “send” and swallows
the lump in his throat.
68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68
Troy gingerly enters into the Dean’s office. Martin and Dean
Fairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, would you share with Troy
what you shared with me?
MARTIN
The server that processes the
voting results for House Elections
has shut down the A.P. database.
Saw it this morning. Apparently the
intermediary program is on a
refractile loop.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man.
MARTIN
Sam currently has 445 votes. That’s
200 more than she had last week
during the actual election.
TROY
There’s not even that many
residents in Armstrong / Parker.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
She cheated. Hacked the system.
69 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY 69
Sam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the
Dean’s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.
73.
SAM
I wouldn’t even begin to know how
to do something like that.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Is your little war really this
important?
Sam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
I understand the pressure to stand
for something at an institution
like this but you’re barking up the
wrong tree okay?
70 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70
MARTIN
Had to have been Reggie. Dude’s in
my programing class. Good. Just
forgot to turn his program off.
TROY
Wow.
MARTIN
You’re the rightful Head of House.
TROY
(shit)
So great.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, let me talk to Troy for a
bit. I appreciate this.
71 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71
Sam glares at Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Your advisor tells me you’re
hanging on by a thread in you
major. Perhaps it’s time to
reprioritize.
SAM
You’re trying to frighten me, but I
think you’re the one who’s scared.
74.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
And I think you long for the days
where Blacks were hanging from
trees and denied actual rights.
Then you’d actually have something
to fight against.
A swell of emotion behind Sam’s steel eyes.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
You will be facing two hearings in
the coming weeks that could end in
either Probation or Suspension. One
on the merits of your show, the
other on your election to Head of
House.
Sam is truly scared by this.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Your responsibilities to your house
are suspended. Your show is done
for. And another one of your
illegal “demonstrations” will only
make matters worse. This is a
critical time for this school.
SAM
You damn right it is.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
We don’t have an intolerance
problem here. Except for the one
I’m looking at.
72 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 72
Troy and his father are alone.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You didn’t tell me you and Sofia
had a misunderstanding.
TROY
Who did?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Her father. She was very upset.
(off Troy’s silence)
Troy. What sort of vision do you
have for yourself?
75.
TROY
Get my degree. Then Law School and
then --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
--And what’s that got to do with
partying with Kurt? With smoking
weed and writing jokes?
Panic flashes over Troy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight
Kurt gets? You want to be on...tv
or something? You know how many
Black men waste their lives to get
on TV? Be rappers and ball players?
TROY
(wanting it to be true)
Dad no. I want what we always
talked about. Maybe have my own
firm someday? Run for office. Make
a difference. Wife. Kids. I want
all that. I really really do.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And the drugs? God damn it Troy I
taught you better than this. I have
been in academia a long time, I’ve
seen a lot of things. The men who
really run this world? You got no
idea what they see when they see
you. You are not going to be what
they all think you are. You will
not give them that satisfaction,
you hear me?
TROY
Yes sir.
73 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73
Sam steps out of Fletcher’s office into the waiting room.
Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other
down as Kurt enters his father’s office.
A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit
the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through
the window.
Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and
listens in.
76.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
I know about the party. You picked
a hell of a time.
KURT
What party --
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
-- You’re cancelling Kurt. End of
story.
75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75
Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
hears...
GEORGE (O.S.)
Lionel’s story on the would-be
protest outside of Gillespie is
running tomorrow and I’m also
having Lionel work on a profile
piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
suggested. Really break down what’s
going on.
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
phone call.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Right. It’s almost like they
recycle so much from their past -
Music, food, fashion, and now
turbulence.
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel’s mouth.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Thank you so much. Okay, take care.
George can’t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.
ANNIE
Well?
GEORGE
That was our Times advisor. He said
it’s stories like these that get
editors recommendation letters.
Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
reassured when they see who it is.
77.
LIONEL
The Negro at the door didn’t scare
you this time.
Annie smiles and heads for the door.
ANNIE
Lionel please. You’re only
technically Black. G, going to
French. You want me to hold your
seat?
GEORGE
Thanks.
Annie smiles and walks out.
LIONEL
You need something? Saw your email.
GEORGE
Yeah, I need someone to do the
Donor’s function on Saturday. Small
dinner for the school’s big givers.
Administration wants a little
coverage.
LIONEL
That’s Halloween night.
GEORGE
Right, which is why no one else
will take it.
LIONEL
Ah. Thus the new guy.
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.
GEORGE
On my way to class, but you can
stay and check out last year’s
piece. You’ll do fine.
LIONEL
I don’t know. Are there going to be
any racially fueled outbursts at
this thing?
GEORGE
Never know right?
78.
It’s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.
LIONEL
Am I a good writer?
GEORGE
You’ll get better. And we need you
right now.
LIONEL
You’re just a big recommendation
away from landing the Times.
GEORGE
God I hope so.
Lionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Hey.
-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So
instead he just kisses him.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I’m glad we finally got that Bugle
on your chest.
Lionel’s all mixed up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
There’s a big party the night of
the Donor’s event. Call me after,
maybe we can hang?
LIONEL
Yeah. Sounds good.
George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed.
76 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76
Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag
to reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He’s getting
ready for something.
His phone buzzes with a notification: “Message from:
PASTICHE”
Troy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...
79.
KURT (V.O.)
Dear White People. Are you tired of
your hum drum, Wonderbread
existence of accidental racism and
wishing you could sip on Henny out
yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving
you the side-eye? Course you are.
MONTAGE:
As our subjects get ready for their evening.
Troy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and
correcting imperceptible imperfections.
KURT (V.O.)
For all those looking to unleash
their inner Negro from years of
bondage and oppression Pastiche
proudly presents “Dear White
People” our 89th annual Hallow’s
Eve Costume Party - tonight at 10
Pacific Time or 5 Colored People
Time. Sorry for the short notice,
but let’s keep it one hun-ed.
You’ve had us on your calendar for
weeks.
76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A
combing out his unwieldy fro. He flinches in pain as he
fluffs out each section.
KURT (V.O.)
Dudes must rock FUBU, Ecko,
Rocawear, or Sean John. XXXL is the
smallest size T-Shirt you can wear,
preferably with a collage of Barack
Obama and Tupac on it. Stunner
Shades, chains, and Blue-Tooth
devices sticking out yo ears are
also encouraged.
76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B
smooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with
foundation. She begins on her eyes.
KURT (V.O.)
Ladies, we need to see huge hoop
earrings, long nails, and cheap
tight clothes.
80.
(MORE)
A proper hood rat starts fights,
speaks loudly, and when she can’t
think of the word she’s trying to
say just makes one up, such as
“edumicated.” Feel free to fry up
some chicken, bring Kool-Aid,
Watermelon, 40s, Henny, and of
course Dat Purple Drank. No bougie
bitches allowed.
76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C
up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around
her ears. She takes in her image in the mirror.
KURT (V.O.)
Naturally there will be a freestyle
rap competition so bring it, get yo
shine on and join us for the party
of the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga. Boy that felt good.
77 EXT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 77
Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside
while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the
entrance. He smokes on Coco’s one-hitter from before.
Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.
The two are surprised to see each other.
LIONEL
Funny seeing you here.
TROY
Father likes to show me off at all
the Donor functions. The dessert
course is usually my cue to take a
breather while they talk shop.
(friendlier)
The trick is to dazzle them into
forking over their estates just
before they kick the bucket.
Lionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.
LIONEL
So...Picard or Kirk?
TROY
Kirk. Wait...
LIONEL
I saw you watching Star --
81.
KURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
TROY
-- Yo what happens in the crib
stays in the crib. Not trying to
get my card revoked.
LIONEL
Hey, some could argue that a show
with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn
and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty
Black show.
TROY
Yeah? That work out for you?
LIONEL
No. No it did not. At least not in
High School. I bet there’s a statue
of you at your High School.
TROY
I was beloved. Won’t lie.
LIONEL
Did they know you were a trekker?
TROY
My pops left a paint by numbers
template for success at that High
School. All I had to do was fill in
the blanks. Football captain.
Valedictorian. Prom King.
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
So what? You’re growing that out?
LIONEL
I think it’s gaining sentience.
TROY
It’s...out there.
LIONEL
It’s like a black hole for white
people’s fingers. They’re obsessed.
TROY
You know I cut hair. Why didn’t you
ask me?
LIONEL
You’re I dunno...you?
82.
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to
Gillespie.
GEORGE
Li! You ready man?
LIONEL
No costumes? I got a tux for this.
ANNIE
We just got out of the staff room.
GEORGE
Yeah, we’re going as overworked.
LIONEL
Where is it?
ANNIE
Garmin House. On third I think?
LIONEL
Third and Basin. I know it.
Before Lionel jets to join them.
TROY
Yo man. If I’d gone to your High
School, I’d have had your back.
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends.
78 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 78
Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos
of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.
79 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 79
The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.
It’s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
“Purple Drank.” Everyone downs the stuff.
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT
Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.
TROY
...my own firm. Maybe run for
office. Make a difference you know?
83.
The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy’s eyes to his phone -
photos from “Dear White People” pop up in his news feed.
80 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 80
Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously
put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
glances at the posters - it’s Kurt with a large Afro wig
mimicking Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyers.
LIONEL
This is kind of fucked up. Right?
GEORGE
Pastiche. The world’s most erudite
boneheads. Who wants another round?
Come on Lionel, help a brother out.
LIONEL
Kitchen’s this way.
80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A
Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She’s
feeling herself as she’s handed a drink.
She’s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.
Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...
COCO
Hey there muffins. How do I look?
Why are white folks so obsessed
with being Black? And why are Black
folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
doll weaves? Honeys it’s a strange
symbiosis we’re here to explore...
Coco’s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her
iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.
80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B
Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the
kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...
80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C
...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales
Lionel’s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel’s hair.
84.
LIONEL
Ouch.
GEORGE
Sorry.
LIONEL
It’s okay. Can’t wait to cut all
this off.
GEORGE
Don’t you dare.
George plunges his fingers into Lionel’s fro once again.
Pulls a touch too hard.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I could eat you like a Hershey’s.
This sets something off in Lionel.
LIONEL
I’ll be right back.
Lionel breaks George’s grasp and heads out the bathroom...
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
...and back out into the party. He’s trapped in a nightmare
of caricatures and reveling students. Can’t breathe.
EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
head as he starts walking away from the party.
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.
KURT
What the hell?
81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81
Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the
dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.
DINING HALL
SAM
For a genius dude you’re a fucking
idiot.
85.
REGGIE
I did it, we did it for you.
SAM
I didn’t ask for it Reggie. I look
like I betrayed this house.
REGGIE
Yeah? Well you betrayed me.
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.
LIONEL
Sam? Can we talk?
Sam turns back around fiercely.
82 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 82
A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED
LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.
The crowd starts to get live now.
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She
continues out back...
83 EXT. KURT’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83
...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a
long straight Black wig and brag to friends...
ANNIE
Hey who am I? “Bitch it’s weave.
Noun. Present tense ho!”
Right in the gut. She’s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...
84 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84
Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give
him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the
others. His phone rings.
KURT
Yeah?
INTERCUT
COCO
Kurt, it’s me. I can’t do this.
86.
KURT
Okay, I’m fucking confused.
85 INT. SAM’S ROOM - NIGHT 85
Lionel sits across from Sam.
SAM
What do you want me to do? Go over
there and yell at them?
LIONEL
Have you heard you yelling?
SAM
This house is filled with folks
willing to take up after a cause
Lionel. Believe me. Never would
have guessed you’d be one of them
but...
LIONEL
For the first time in my life, I
can’t just sit around and do
nothing. How can you?
SAM
If I’m caught being a part of
anything like this...it wouldn’t be
good for me right now okay?
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door.
SAM (CONT’D)
I’m done being everybody’s angry
Black chick.
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.
Sam’s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.
86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86
Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining
room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other
students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.
86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A
Lionel gingerly walks in the room. He’s still an outsider
here - but something’s changed in him.
87.
LIONEL
Hey. How’s it going. Hi.
No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Hey...what is this?
SUNGMI
Black Student Union.
Lionel smiles shyly. He should’ve known that.
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.
DREADS
Your call then man.
REGGIE
(to everyone)
Alright ya’ll - thanks for coming
out tonight. Looks like Sam’s not
making it so...let’s just call it.
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...
LIONEL
Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I’m Lionel. Some
of you...none of you probably know
me. I’ve never been to a meeting.
But I just came back from a party
on campus and I think you should
know about it.
Lionel’s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He’s got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Anybody mind if I?
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean...I don’t know. This is
fucked up right?
REGGIE
Alright brother. What’s the plan?
88.
Lionel realizes the eyes aren’t judging. They’re mobilizing.
Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.
LIONEL
We go over there. Now.
CURLS
Think there’s enough of us?
SUNGMI
You know you don’t have a monopoly
on being a pissed off minority.
Latino’s United is meeting across
the hall. Asian American League
too.
(off the stares)
You guys got better snacks.
87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87
Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.
Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to
his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President
Fletcher.
TROY
Dad...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Not now Troy.
TROY
It’s important. There’s something
happening on campus. I might’ve...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’re being rude son.
Dean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--
TROY
Oh am I? How about I tell your
precious donors and anyone here
who’ll listen about the kind of a
school it is they’re giving to?
The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on
him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.
89.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t know who you think you are
young man but you don’t get to talk
to your father any kind of way.
TROY
All I say to you is yes sir and no
sir! Look I should’ve brought this
up before but --
(off Fairbanks dismissal)
-- listen to me!
Dean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.
88 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88
Kurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.
KURT
What?
GORDON
Yeah dude. We all got it. I mean,
everything’s cool right?
A noise in the other room startles them...
88A LIVING ROOM 88A
...It’s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues
with a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid’s face. The
party swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.
A SMASH yanks Kurt’s attention back to the kitchen...
88B KITCHEN 88B
...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.
KURT
Lionel?
Kurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.
KURT (CONT’D)
The fuck you think you’re doing
man?
Lionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids
flood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.
KURT (CONT’D)
That all you got?
90.
LIONEL
We’re putting an end to this Kurt.
KURT
Fuck you I’m calling the cops.
MARTIN
Half of this crowd is under 21.
A loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the
Living Room.
88C LIVING ROOM 88C
Mitch has taken over the mic.
MITCH
Gimme that mic
Before I slap ya
Looking for some dykes,
that wanna another chapta.
If you do me slow,
you can do me faster,
I’ll pass you to the Nigga on my
right, he gets you after.
LIONEL
Kurt--
KURT
-- Why don’t you tuck your tail
between your legs, run and tell the
Dean and get the fuck out.
Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.
Lionel turns to go and spots...
...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
behind George is...
...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.
Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.
Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
one of the rapper’s hands.
LIONEL
Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!
91.
The crowd is with it - thinks it’s part of the show as Lionel
proceeds to freestyle terribly...
LIONEL (CONT’D)
My name is Lionel,
Some people call me Li.
Lots of people think
that I talk kinda white.
Well that’s alright.
Yeah that’s cool.
I’d rather you think I’m white,
than tap dance for you.
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.
Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.
Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel’s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.
Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.
More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.
Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.
Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.
The steel in Sam’s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?
And then she spots...
...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam’s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.
COCO
What? Say it. Come on.
Sam stays silent.
COCO (CONT’D)
This may come as a shock, but these
people don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. They
pay millions of dollars on their
tans, their lips, their asses, Jay-
Z tickets, you name it, cause they
wanna be us.
92.
(MORE)
So they got to be for a night.I’m
not about to go out into the
streets in protest of a Halloween
party.
Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
realizes it’s herself she’s trying to convince.
Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.
89 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 89
Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her
lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.
90 EXT. KURT’S YARD - NIGHT 90
Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the
ground.
KURT
Dude. I know you can’t help it...
Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.
KURT (CONT’D)
...but why are you such a fag dude?
Lionel spits in Kurt’s face and pops right back up again. We
see it in his eyes - he’ll never give up.
Kurt’s hand is on Lionel’s collar. He pushes him down again.
Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.
Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt’s eyes.
Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.
LIONEL
Finally got me where you want me.
Kurt’s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.
Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt’s let up. For a
moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.
The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.
The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.
93.
COCO (CONT’D)
Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -
One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a
couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.
91 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 91
The motor on Sam’s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a
complete standstill.
Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact
with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.
Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos.
Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What is all this?
92 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92
A SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN
We see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.
CUT TO:
92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A
party. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.
Windows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the
lawn. Ash where fires were put out.
KURT
I didn’t do this. Sam. I had
nothing to do with this.
CUT TO:
92B MORNING NEWS 92B
ANCHOR
What some are calling a “race war”
has erupted at one of the nation’s
oldest and most prestigious --
CUT TO:
92 GILLESPIE FORUM now filled with students who sit before 92
Dean Fairbanks and President Fletcher for a Town Hall.
Everyone wears a look of outrage.
94.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We don’t condone this egregious
event and are investigating its
origins. The president and I are
looking at ways to address issues
of Diversity at Manchester.
REGGIE
HOUSING REFORM!
Applause breaks out amongst the crowd. But so do boos.
CUT TO:
93 VARIOUS SPOTS AROUND CAMPUS. Students address the camera. 93
MITCH
I’m sorry but it’s bullshit. Yo
this is how we get down. If you
can’t take a joke in this day and
age? The fact we can joke about it
proves we’ve moved on you feel me?
This is an attack on free speech!
We’re the victims here!
CUT TO:
93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A
of Armstrong / Parker where Lionel address the camera...
LIONEL
It’s hard enough for us to even get
into a school like this. Let alone
succeed. Find our way. This is only
a debate because of who Kurt’s dad
is, which just proves the point.
All you did was have a radio show
and look what happened to you.
CUT TO:
93B COCO as she talks directly to camera. 93B
COCO
I know this may come as a shock,
but nobody gives a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...they
wanna be us. So they got to be for
a night.
CUT TO:
95.
93C A POSTER featuring Troy rendered like the famous Shepard 93C
Fairy Obama posters with the words “A NEW HOPE” written at
the bottom as well as “TROY BROUSSARD FOR PRESIDENT.” This
gets some more applause from the crowd watching.
TROY
Of course I got my dad involved. It
was the right thing to do. I didn’t
mean for all this to happen. All
the posters and everything.
SAM (O.S.)
But you’d welcome it? A shot for
school president.
TROY
I think...I’d make more than few
people happy if I ran.
CUT TO:
93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. She 93D
lingers.
SAM (V.O.)
Even though I’d been expressly
forbidden to do so, I wanted to do
one last show. Something to sum up
the moment. To savor in the pop of
the post racial bubble just burst.
SAM
Dear White People...
SAM (V.O.)
I wanted to react.
Sam takes in a thoughtful breath before...
SAM
...Know what? Nevermind.
She fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her
headpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in:
“...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE”
Sam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on,
when all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE. Sam turns to
see that the entire room is on it’s feet including Prof
Bodkin and Gabe.
96.
94 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 94
Dean Fairbanks loosens his tie, flanked by several SCHOOL
OFFICIALS. They’ve been here for hours listening to...
KURT
Once I heard what the group was
planning, I sent out an email to
the staff to cancel it. You have
the email printed in front of you.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Who’s this?
Kurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him.
KURT
My lawyer.
CUT TO:
94B We’ll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B
COCO
So when I got the invite and saw
everyone clicking “yes” I figured
it was back on.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You were hoping to make the staff?
COCO
...
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
At what point in time did you show
up to the event?
94C Sam sits with arms folded. 94C
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Samantha. Please.
SAM
Why am I even here?
CUT TO:
KURT
94 Guys throw parties at the house all 94
the time.
97.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We know you were planning this.
KURT
Your son tell you that?
CUT TO:
94D Fairbanks stares down his son. Troy is silent and anxious.9 4D
DEAN FAIRBANKS
(reading)
“...wishing you could sip on Henny
out yo crunk cup without a Bitch
giving you the side-eye?”
(and then)
You write this Troy?
Troy looks up at his father embarrassed.
TROY
No. Mine wasn’t chosen.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you wanted to be?
TROY
What I wanted didn’t matter then.
Why should it matter now? I told
you about the party, remember?
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94
Facebook account.
KURT
I loathe Facebook.
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear.
KURT (CONT’D)
You’ve got to believe me.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’ve used that line on me before
this year Mr. Fletcher. When a
homophobic message mysteriously
appeared on a voice mail line you
shared with a roommate.
CUT TO:
98.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
What were your intentions when you
went back the second time?
LIONEL
To stop it.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
By any means necessary?
LIONEL
Someone once told me...Manchester
is like jazz. I don’t know much
about jazz. But from what I can
tell, when your solo’s up, you
better blow.
Fairbanks fights a smile.
CUT TO:
94C SAM 94C
All I did that night was hit record
brother.
The Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and
looks out his huge windows onto the campus below.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials 94E
are taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day.
The Dean tries a few passwords.
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C
Want to hear something strange?
The Dean turns from the window.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
The Pastiche group page hadn’t been
used for months, until the invite
went out.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries a different password. Still invalid. 94E
CUT TO:
99.
94C SAM 94C
Fascinating.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Well what’s interesting is how easy
it was to access the group before
the note was sent. The password was
“Pa$tiche” spelled with a dollar
sign according to Kurt. Seems
recently it’s been changed.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries one more. It works. 94E
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D) 94C
Couldn’t figure it out at first.
Then I thought to try something.
Five, seven, eight, three, five,
twenty six, one, nine, four, six.
Eleven numbers. Just like our
student ID numbers. Just like your
student ID number.
SAM
As much as you hate him, you will
stop at nothing to protect your
master and his boy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Did you send out the invite Sam?
SAM
That invite, whoever sent it
should’ve been met with derision
and outrage. Instead, a hundred
people showed up and they pulled
out posters and decorations and
costumes they’d made for just such
an occasion.
Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.
Silence falls in the room. The Dean’s mind ticks.
95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95
A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the
headline: “INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO
EXPULSIONS MADE”
100.
Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT
OBSERVER. The headline reads: “EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE
HARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...
96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL’S APARTMENT - DAY 96
Lionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied
grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.
LIONEL
2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless
complex depictions of whites, white
men in particular exist - there
aren’t that many versions of us in
the culture.
His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and
fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel’s head.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Culture has a powerful way of
telling people what they can and
can’t be. For people of color the
options are rather limited.
TROY
Next James Baldwin up in here. Wait
hold on a sec.
Star Trek is back from commercial break. Troy and Lionel
watch in silence.
97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97
Gabe is just about finished with Lionel’s article too. Looks
up just in time to see...
GABE
Hello Sam.
Sam sneers at his formalities.
GABE (CONT’D)
Read about Armstrong / Parker.
SAM
Yeah. Prez made an executive
withdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.
GABE
Congrats?
101.
SAM
(with a shrug)
Getting too dramatic man. Thinking
about getting an apartment off
campus. We’ll see.
GABE
Sam going against the grain?
Shocked. How’s papa White?
SAM
He’s recovering.
GABE
Good. Well...
Gabe fights the urge to hug her.
SAM
We were actually on the phone last
night for hours. First time we
talked since the bypass. He was
putting up a strong front. Teasing
me about being so worried. Then
came the stories about me as a
little girl I’d heard a thousand
times. About how independent I was.
Gabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.
GABE
Want to talk about it?
SAM
My mother worked nights so he would
take me to school. And it pissed me
off because he would follow me all
the way to homeroom. Every time he
tried to hold my hand I’d scream
and pull away. He thought I was
just being...difficult.
A hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?
SAM (CONT’D)
But it was the kids. And the
parents and the teachers. They’d
see this Black girl and this white
man and wonder what we were doing
together. Even at nine I could feel
their eyes on me. Especially at
nine. It brought tears to my eyes.
Gabe’s stone face melts at this.
102.
SAM (CONT’D)
I was just a bratty girl, didn’t
know any better but-- The thought
of losing him-- You know? I just
feel so bad. How awful am I to do
that to him? To anyone I love?
Gabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His
arm is on her shoulder now.
GABE
I’m sure he forgives you.
SAM
Think so?
Gabe nods. Sam’s normal defenses come back up lest she cries.
SAM (CONT’D)
So anyway. I didn’t mean to say all
of that. I don’t know why I did.
GABE
Sam. Where are you going?
SAM
I don’t know. Lunch?
Gabe starts to walk with her.
GABE
Isn’t it Mac and Cheese day at
Armstrong/Parker?
SAM
Think they’ll let you in?
Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam
lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into
each others’ eyes.
Don’t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.
98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98
Coco sits across from Helmut. He’s got his eyes on a Youtube
clip from Sam’s movie featuring Coco.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
I know this may come as a shock,
but they don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...
103.
HELMUT
Two hundred thousand views. Look
they even auto-tuned it.
With a click Helmut pulls it up.
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin
Tubman! Don’t give a fuck about no
muthafuckin Tubman!
Coco’s not sure what to think.
HELMUT
Couple months, that’s how long
shooting for an episode takes. We
recommend you cut your course load
in half to accommodate the
schedule.
COCO
Half?
HELMUT
Trust me it it’ll read “full-time”
in the episode. If...once we go to
series, we might have to figure out
a summer schedule.
COCO
For shooting?
HELMUT
For uh...classes and stuff. Won’t
be graduating early anymore
sweetheart.
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Five grand for the episode. Twenty
each if you get picked up for
series. What do you say?
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Trust me sweetie it’s the same out
there as it is in here. Good news
is? Against all that damn white you
and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be
the go-to producer for all things
Black?
104.
Coco shrugs.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Tell you what’s worse though. Being
that broke Nigga stuck on the south
side of Chicago. Hundred and
Fiftieth street.
Coco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --
99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99
Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He’s flanked
by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other
BoFros. They all carry Troy’s “New Hope” posters.
COCO
Made some new friends?
Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and
shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn’t approve.
COCO (CONT’D)
Fine.
TROY
Come on Coco.
COCO
Fuck you.
Coco starts to walk ahead.
TROY
My dad saw your videos. He’s a
little worried about --
COCO
-- how it’ll look. With your
campaign and all. What’s your best
friend Reggie think?
Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.
TROY
We had fun, alright?
COCO
I get everyone else wants you to
win Troy. But do you?
Troy doesn’t know how to answer that. He stares at the
triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.
105.
Coco’s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.
Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
Sungmi. They both know that look well...
SAM
Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy
moving on - A/P’s going to need a
new head of house.
LIONEL
Think there’s a story there? Who do
you think it’ll be?
Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
What? No.
SUNGMI
Everyone loves you. Won’t be hard
to rally the vote.
SAM
Yeah. We got you man.
Lionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.
100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100
Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher’s office to join
him at his desk. They’re all ears as they look across to...
HELMUT
Let me get this straight. First you
tried to break up the Black house.
Then you took down the sister with
the little radio show. And after
all that, your kid throws a
Blackface party?
FLETCHER
Now wait a minute!
HELMUT
You thought you were having money
problems before? Wait till cable
gets their hands on this story.
Bill Maher is gon’ fuck you up!
FLETCHER
I have heard enough --
106.
HELMUT
-- Wait I’m sorry. Look from where
I’m sitting this place is a
goldmine.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What?
HELMUT
For one we got to show the events
that led up to the party --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- That already happened.
HELMUT
Well yeah, but we can reenact --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- reenact?
HELMUT
Documentary term...Look, I can
start putting together an overall
deal today. I’m talking real money!
Turns out the one thing America
likes in it’s reality more than
ignant Black folks, is crazy racist
White people!
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Now you look here. This is an
honorable institution. The idea
that we would so much as entertain
this suggestion --
Fletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.
FLETCHER
How much we talking?
Fairbanks’ outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one
winner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.

[Postlude - Spoken]
Now ""King Porter"" was the first stomp, or the first tune with the name stomp, wrote in the United States
[clears throat] You must pardon me for clearing my throat, 'cause I've gotta do it occasionally

Of course, I'll tell you the fact about it, I don't know what the name stomp mean, myself. It really wasn't any meaning, only that people would stamp their feet, and I decided that the name stomp would be fitted for it

Of course, this tune . . . I was inspired by the name from a very dear friend of mine, and a marvelous pianist, now in the cold, cold ground - a gentleman from Florida, an educated gentleman with a wonderful musical education, far much better than mine. Now this gentleman's name was Mr. King - Porter King. And of course, he seemed to have a kind of a yen for my style of playing, although we had two different styles of playing.  And of course he particularly liked this type of number that I'm playing, and that was the reason that I named it after him. But not Porter King, I changed the name backwards and named it ""King Porter Stomp""

Now this tune become the biggest, the outstanding favorite of every hot band throughout the world that had the accomplishments, the qualifications of playing it. And until today, this tune has been the cause of many great bands to come to fame.  It has caused the outstanding tunes today to use the backgrounds that belong to King Porter in all that make great tunes of themselves

(question in the background) When did you write this song?

OVER BLACK WE SEE:

CHYRON

A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far
away--

EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY

We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from
sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK --
a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A
white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap
comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an
oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe,
and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in
the Mother's hands.
MOTHER
Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks
up the free cheese, 'kay?

She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly,
then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her
baseball cap and places it on the baby.

MOTHER
This'll keep the sun out of your
eyes. You be good now.

She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall.
With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his
mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks
kind of familiar.

Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS
concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair
enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip.
She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets
her Baby down beside him.

MOTHER
Don't fucking move, you little shit-
machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.
A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He
takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the
record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.

PASSERBY
Excuse me--who's watching these
babies?

MOTHER
The fat one's watching the little
one.

PASSERBY
Oh, nice parenting.
(walking away)
Leave'em out here like that and see
what happens.

The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.

MOTHER
FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!

PASSERBY
(waving her off)
Ah, keep on truckin'.
MOTHER
(to baby)
D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me
how to fuckin' raise you?
Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking
think he is? What's the worse fuckin'
thing could happen to you sitting
outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!

The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat.
Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing.
The smaller one says--

BABY
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

DISSOLVE TO:

THE PRESENT

JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record
Rack is now RST VIDEO.

Jay is mid-chant.

JAY
(as a chant)
--fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother
fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-
fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,
noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed,
smoking weed, doing coke, drinking
beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers,
rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who
smokes the blunts? We smoke the
blunts!

A pair of TEENS approach them.

TEEN 1
Lemme get a nickel bag.

JAY
Fifteen bucks, little man. Put that
shit in my hand. If the money does
not show, then you owe-me-owe-me-
owe.
(changing up to Morris
Day)
My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh!
I think I want to know ya', know ya'--

TEEN 1
(digging in pockets)
What the hell are you singing?

JAY
You don't know ""Jungle Love""? That
shit is the mad notes. Written by
God Herself and handed down to the
world's greatest band--the
motherfucking Time.

TEEN 2
The guys in that Prince movie?

TEEN 1
Purple Rain.

TEEN 2
Man, that shit was so gay--fucking
eighties style.

Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against
the wall.

JAY
Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind
word about The Time! Me and Silent
Bob modeled our whole fucking lives
after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a
smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and
Tubby here's my black manservant!

Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door
behind him.

RANDAL
What'd I tell you two about dealing
in front of the store? Drop the kid
and peddle your wares someplace else,
burn-boy.
(walking away)
And for the record, The Time sucked
ass.

He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After
a beat--

JAY
Yo-youse guys wanna hear something
fucked up about him and the Quick
Stop guy?

INT. QUICK STOP-DAY

Randal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a
customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the
counter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a
newspaper.

RANDAL
Hey, can't we do something about
those two stoners hanging around
outside all the time?

DANTE
Why? What'd they do now?

RANDAL
I'm trying to watch Clash of the
Titans, and all I can hear is the
two them screaming about Morris Day
at the top of their lungs.

DANTE
I thought the fat one didn't really
talk much.

RANDAL
What, am I producing an A&E Biography
about 'em? I'm just saying they
shouldn't be loitering around the
stores like they do.

DANTE
Neither should you, but we let you
stay.

RANDAL
See, man--if you were funnier than
that, ABC never would've canceled
us.

DANTE
What?

RANDAL
Nothing.

Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling.

TEEN 1
Two packs of Wraps.
(beat)
Yo--how was the service?

RANDAL
What service?

TEEN 2
The one at the Unitarian church where
you two got married to each other
last week.

RANDAL
What the hell are you talking about?

TEEN 1
Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed
wedding and you guys tied the knot
dressed like storm troopers.

TEEN 2
Yeah. And he said you're the bitch
and you're the butch. Oh, sorry--the
Leia and the Luke.

DANTE
I'm the bitch?!

RANDAL
Well if we were gay, that's how I'd
see it.

DANTE
Would you shut up?!

TEEN 1
(to TEEN 2)
Holy shit, dude. The honeymoon's
over.

DANTE
We're not married to each other.

TEEN 1
Well, sure. Not in the eyes of the
state or any real church, Skywalker.

RANDAL
(heading for the phone)
That does it. I'm gonna do something
about those two. I shoulda done a
long time ago

TEEN 2
In a galaxy far, far away!

TEEN 1
(exiting)
May the Foreskin be with you. Hand
Jabba the Hutt.

RANDAL
(into phone)
Yeah, I want to report a couple of
drug dealers out in front of the
Quick Stop.

EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a
COP, who frisks them.

JAY
What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we
do?

COP
We got a report that two guys were
hanging around outside the stores,
selling pot?

JAY
We don't smoke pot, yo.

Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.

TEEN 1
Here're the rolling papers you wanted
for your pot. And your change. Thanks.
(getting in Jay's
face)
And The Time sucks ass!

Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop
stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand.
He eyeballs the pair.

COP
No pot, hunh? What do you need this
for?

JAY
What?  I got a wiping problem. I
stick these little pieces of paper
over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit
stains in my undies.
(unbuttoning pants)
You don't believe me? Lemme show
you.

Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back
over his shoulder.

JAY
Just spread my cheeks a little and
you can see the fucking stink nuggets--

COP
Pull up your pants up sir, Now!

Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob
cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the
car.

COP
Let's take a ride down to the station.

JAY
What? It's suddenly a crime to fart,
motherfucker?!

EXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY

An ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red
Bank.

BRODIE (O.S.)
No fucking way!

WE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--

INT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER

BRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a
Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he
puts new books in the racks.

BRODIE
Dante and Randal slapped you with a
restraining order?!

JAY
Judge said if we go within a hundred
feet of the stores, we get thrown
into County.

BRODIE
So you gonna abide by the court's
ruling or you gonna go Bandit--
Reynolds style?

JAY
Fuck yeah! You know what they make
you do in county? Toss the fucking
salad! I don't like this fuck's
asshole; I'm gonna do it for some
stranger?

BRODIE
I guess if you really wanted to hang
out in from of a convenience store,
you could just buy your own now--
what with all that money you guys
made.

JAY
Hell yeah, bitch.
(beat)
Wait a second--what money?

BRODIE
The money from the movie, dumb-ass.

JAY
What the fuck are you babbling about?

BRODIE
(pulling a bagged-and-
boarded issue down
from the wall)
The Bluntman and Chronic movie.
(dawns on him)
Oh my God--don't tell me you have no
idea there's a movie being made of
the comic you two were the basis
for.

JAY
What?! Since when?

BRODIE
Goddamit, man--
(taps his wrist)
Here's the pulse, alright. And here's
your finger--
(shoves his hand down
the back of his pants)
--far from the pulse, jammed straight
up your ass.
(extracts hand and
extends it to Jay)
Say--would you like a chocolate
covered pretzel?

Brodie leads them back to the counter.

BRODIE
You see, kids, if you read Wizard,
you'd know it's the top story this
month.  Check it out.

Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to
the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get
Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL
AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and
Chronic.

JAY
When the fuck did this happen?!

BRODIE
Well, after X-Men hit at the box
office, all the studios started buying
up every comic property they could
get their hands on. Miramax optioned
Bluntman and Chronic.

JAY
Miramax? I thought they only made
classy flicks like The Piano and The
Crying Game?

BRODIE
Yeah, well once they made She's All
That, everything went to hell. So
you're saying you haven't gotten a
cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil
and Banky Edwards used to pay you
likeness rights for the comic book?

JAY
We haven't seen a fucking dime for
no movie!

BRODIE
Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think
Holden and Banky owe you some of the
proverbial phat cash. I mean they're
making a movie based on characters
that are based on you and Quiet
Robert.

JAY
It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a
pair of stupid-ass superheroes that
run around saying ""Snitchy-Nitchies""
or something.

BRODIE
I believe it ""Snootchie Boochies.""
Regardless--you're getting screwed.
If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden
McNeil and ask him for my movie check.

JAY
Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.

BRODIE
And on that note, we cue the music.

Jay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with
his own beat.

EXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building
and knock.

INT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.

HOLDEN
Well! I have been waiting years to
do this.
(smiles)
Look at these morose motherfuckers
right here. Smells like someone shit
in their cereal. Bunngg!

Jay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following
them.

JAY
What the fuck took you so long
answering your damn door? You trying
to talk another girlfriend of yours
into some of that gay-ass three-way
action with your buddy?

HOLDEN
No, I was just showering your mother's
stink off me after I gave her a quick
jump and sent her home. But now that
you mention it--
(to Bob)
Thanks, you know. You could've made
the moral of that story you told me
a bit more clear.

Silent Bob shrugs.

HOLDEN
So what brings you two dirt merchants
to my neck of the woods?

JAY
Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are
doing in your woods--

Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article.

JAY
Where's our motherfucking movie check?

HOLDEN
You heard about that too, Hunh? Well,
I've got nothing to do with it. That's
Banky's deal. He owns the property
now. I signed my half of the Bluntman
and Chronic right over to him years
ago.

JAY
Why the fuck would you do a thing
like that?

HOLDEN
Because I'm almost thirty, for God's
sake--why on earth would I want to
keep writing about characters whose
central preoccupations are weed and
dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,
man. Don't you ever want more for
yourself?
(off Silent Bob)
I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch
does. I look in his doe eyes and I
see a man crying out, ""When, Lord?
When the fuck can your servant ditch
this foul-mouthed little chucklehead
to whom I am a constant victim of
his folly, and who bombards me and
those around us with grade-A
foolishness that prevents me from
even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck!
When?!

Silent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at
him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.

JAY
I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're
the dumb-ass who gave away his comic,
and now you ain't got no fat movie
check neither.

HOLDEN
When you're right, you're right. I
wish I'd broken off a little piece
for myself. Because if the buzz is
any indication, the movie's gonna
make some huge bank.

JAY
What buzz?

HOLDEN
The Internet buzz.

JAY
What the fuck is the Internet?

INT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER

Holden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look
over his shoulder.

HOLDEN
The Internet is a communication device
that allows people the world over to
bitch about movies and share
pornography with one another.
(off monitor)
Here's what we're looking for: ""Movie
PoopShoot.com""

JAY
(to Bob)
""PoopChute."" Yeaaahhh.

HOLDEN
This is a site full of militant movie
buffs: sad bastards who live in their
parents' basements, downloading
scripts and trading what they believe
to be inside info about movies and
actors they despise yet can't stop
discussing. This is where you go if
you wanna hear frustrated would-be
filmmakers mouth off with their two-
bit, arm-chair-director's opinions
on how they all could've made a better
Episode One.

On the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up.
Holden begins navigating the site.

HOLDEN
Here. This is about the Bluntman
movie.
(reading)
""Inside sources tell me Miramax is
starting production this Friday on
their adaptation of underground comic
fave Bluntman and Chronic.""

JAY
Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's
playing us in the movie?

HOLDEN
No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure
it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
They put'em in a bunch of movies.

JAY
Who?

HOLDEN
You know--the guys from Good Will
Hunting.

JAY
You mean the fucking movie with Mork
from Ork in it?

HOLDEN
Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either.
Though Affleck was the bomb in
Phantoms.

JAY
Word, bitch. Phantoms like a
motherfucker.

Holden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again.

HOLDEN
Now down here is where you can gauge
the buzz. This is the Shoot Back
area. It's where people who read the
news get to chime in with their two
cents. Here's what a guy who goes by
the chick-magnet Net handle of ""Wampa-
One"" thinks about Bluntman and
Chronic.
(reading)
""Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid
alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only
work in small doses, if at all. They
don't deserve their own movie.""
(to Jay)
He's got a point.

JAY
Fuck him. What's the next one say?

HOLDEN
(reading)
""Bluntman and Chronic is the worst
comic I ever read. Jay and Silent
Bob are stupid characters. A couple
of stoners who spout dumb-ass
catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech
and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay
and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their
stupid asses.""

JAY
Who the fuck said that shit?!

HOLDEN
A guy who calls himself ""Magnolia-
Fan.""  Check out what the guy after
him said: ""Jay and Silent Bob are
terrible, one-note jokes that only
stoners laugh at.  They're fucking
clown shoes. If they were real, I'd
beat the shit out of them for being
so stupid. I can't believe Miramax
would have anything to so with this
shit. I, for one, will be boycotting
this movie. Who's with me?""
(leans back)
And then there are about fifty more
posts from people who agree to join
Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick.

JAY
(grimly)
I'm gonna kill all these fucks--

HOLDEN
Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a
bunch of jealous little dicks who
use the anonymity of the Net to insult
people who're doing what they wish
they were doing, and number two,
they're not really talking about you
guys--they talking about Bluntman
and Chronic.

JAY
But they said Jay and Silent Bob!
They used our real names. It doesn't
matter that there's a comic book
version of us and a real version,
'cause nobody knows we're real in
real life.

HOLDEN
Really.

JAY
Yeah! And all these people who read
that shit think the real Jay and
Silent Bob are a couple of faggots
'cause of that all these dicks are
writing about the comic book Jay and
Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me
and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,
and she'll be like ""Oooo! I want to
suck youse guys dicks off. What's
your names?""  And I'll be like, ""Jay
and Silent Bob."" And she'll be like,
""Oh--I read on the Internet that
youse guys were little fucking
jerkoffs.""  And then she goes and
sucks two other guys's dicks off
instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta
put a stop to these hateful sonsa-
bitches before they ruin our good
names!

HOLDEN
First off, I don't know how good
your names really are. Secondly,
there's not much you can do about
stopping this bile. The Internet's
given everyone in America a voice,
and everyone in American has chosen
to use that voice to bitch about
movies. As long as there's a Bluntman
and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are
gonna have something negative to say
about it.  Jay steams, thinking.
Then, a light dawns on him.

JAY
But wait a second--if there wasn't a
Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no
one would be saying shit about Jay
and Silent Bob, right?

HOLDEN
They're not saying anything about
you now--they're talking about
fictional characters!

JAY
(oblivious to Holden;
to Bob)
So all we gotta do is stop 'em from
making the movie!

HOLDEN
Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in royalties
you're due in the process. Are you
fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably
not alone in the opinion that this
flick is the worst idea since Greedo
shooting first. I mean, a Jay and
Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to
see that?

Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for
a beat. Then--

HOLDEN
But since it is happening, you might
as well just ignore the idiots on
the Internet, go find Banky, and get
your ""motherfucking movie check."" As
you so succinctly put it. That's
what's important here.

JAY
No, Holden McNeil--what's important
here is that there's a bunch of
motherfuckers we don't even know
calling us assholes on the Internet
to a bunch of teenagers and guys who
can't even get laid. Putting a stop
to that is the most important thing
we could ever do.
(off monitor)
When did it say they're making that
movie?

HOLDEN
They start this Friday.

JAY
So if today's Tuesday, that gives us--
(counts)
Eight days.

HOLDEN
It's more like three days.

JAY
Right. Three days to stop that stupid
fucking movie from getting made!
C'mon, Silent Bob--

Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.

JAY
We're going to Hollywood.

They stride off. Holden shakes his head.

HOLDEN
Now that's what I call the Blunt
leading the Blunt.

EXT. BUS STATION--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled ""Los
Angeles."" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After
a beat, they re-emerge.

JAY
Tickets? Since when did they start
charging for the bus?

They head toward the depot.

JAY
Didn't we used to ride that shit to
school every day for free?

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.

INT. BUS--SAME

Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER.

JAY
We in Hollywood yet?

DRIVER
It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles,
sir. We left twenty minutes ago.

JAY
I didn't ask you about Los Angeles.
I asked you about Hollywood.

DRIVER
Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.

JAY
Don't change the subject! Are we in
Hollywood yet or not?

DRIVER
Please sit down, sir.

Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.

JAY
Why don't you take your seat Ralph
Kramden--

Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.

JAY
I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't
shit to so on this bus.

Silent Bob mimes jerking off.

JAY
I already did that. Twice.

Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across
the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld
video game. He leans over to him.

JAY
Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.

CHILD
Leave me alone, little kid.

The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning
to Silent Bob.

JAY
That fuck called me a little kid and
gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!

Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, ""He's
ten years old.""

JAY
You're my muscle, ain'tcha?

Silent Bob kind of nods.

JAY
So go open a can of whup-ass on that
little fuck, and get me his game!

Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the
aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and
registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.

Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches
for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts
punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his
seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay
looks at Silent Bob.

JAY
You're one tough motherfucker, you
know that?

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The bus pulls over by the side of the road.

INT. BUS--DAY

The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the
bus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.

PASSENGER
They been in there going on half an
hour now! Two of them! Doing God
knows what!

The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.

DRIVER
This bus isn't moving another inch
unless you clear out of there right
now!

No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.

DRIVER
DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!
NOW!!

The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive
amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the
bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed
into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.

JAY
Um--I think something's burning back
here.

EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left
behind.

JAY
The whole fucking world's against
us, dude. I swear to God.

Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.

EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.

JAY
This sucks balls, man. How come we
ain't getting no rides?

VOICE
'Cause you're doing it all wrong.

Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.

GUY
You gotta induce the drivers a little.

JAY
Like how?

GUY
Like this.

The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head
For Ride.

JAY
Yeah, but what happens when you get
in the car, and you don't make with
the head? Don't they kick your ass
to the curb?

GUY
Sure--if you don't make with the
head.

Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--

JAY
Eww! You eat the cock?!?

GUY
Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred
miles across country. I'll take a
shot in the mouth.

JAY
Yeah, but we ain't gay.

GUY
Well, neither am I. But have you
seen the price of bus tickets lately?
Shit--I don't wanna cough up two
hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.

JAY
Well, I don't wanna cough up some
dude's sperm!

GUY
Don't be so suburban--this is the
new millennium. Gay, straight--it's
all the same now. There're no more
lines.

Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.

JAY
There's one. On this side of it, we
ain't gay.

GUY
All hitchers do this. Why do you
think people pick us up? If you get
a ride, it's expected--I don't care
who the driver is. It's the first
rule in the Book.

JAY
What book?

GUY
The unwritten Book of the Road.

A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy
points to it, as if to say ""See?"" The passenger-side door
opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He
looks out the window at Jay and Bob.

GUY
Follow the rules of the Book, and
you'll get where you're going in no
time.  Excuse me.

Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go
face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers
smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.

Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR
pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window
and leans toward them.

NUN
You two boys need a ride?

INT. CAR--LATER

The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back
seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.

NUN
You both don't have to sit back there.
One of you can sit up here with me.

Silent Bob shakes his head ""no"" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs
up front.

NUN
So where are you boys from?

JAY
New Jersey.

NUN
What brings you to Indiana?

JAY
We're going to Hollywood.

NUN
Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways
away.

JAY
Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.

NUN
Well, do unto others. That's what
the Book says.

JAY
(misinterpreting
completely)
Wait a minute--you follow the Book,
too?

NUN
I live my life by it.

JAY
Really? You?

NUN
Of course. You know how lonely it
gets on the road? Thanks to the Book,
I'm never alone--if you know what I
mean.

JAY
I guess. This guy back there explained
it to us. But I didn't think you'd
be into that.

NUN
Are you kidding? I've dedicated my
life to it. Every hour of every day.

JAY
Shit--you nuns are alright.

NUN
You live by the Book, too?

JAY
You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.

NUN
That's good to hear. But it takes
deed, not words. It's a lot easier
to say you live by the Book than to
actually do it.
(looks at him)
Can you do it?

JAY
You want me to do it right now?

NUN
No time like the present, right?

Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head
""no."" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and
starts to bend down.

JAY
Alright.
(he suddenly stops)
You hear that? She's not a Catholic.
She's a Presbyterian.

Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.

EXT. ROADSIDE--DAY

The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets
kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent
Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his
mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.

JAY
Dude--she had seventies bush.

EXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT

Jay and Bob continue hitching.

JAY
I can't believe this shit. Five hours
and not a single ride. Every day,
millions of people hitch to Hollywood
and stop studios from making movies
about 'em. But when you and me try
it, it's like we're trapped in a
fucking cartoon!

A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the
raid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,
and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.

INT. VAN--NIGHT

Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--

A clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed
Beauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.

Jay looks at Silent Bob.

JAY
Zoinks, yo

GUY
And now we can finally solve the
mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!
Pull off their masks and let's see
who they really are!

BOOKISH
I don't think they are masks.

BEAUTY
I don't think they're Hitchhiking
Girls either.

BOOKISH
Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.
(to herself)
Though I wish they were hitchhiking
girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking
girls--

GUY
Let's kick them out. We've got a
mystery to solve.

DUDE
The only mystery here is why we take
our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!

GUY
Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you
to the fucking dog!

BEAUTY
(covering her ears;
shrieking)
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!

JAY
YO!

The Gang look to Jay and Bob.

JAY
Youse guys need to turn those frowns
upside down! And we got just the
thing for that.
(pulls out a bag of
joints)
We call them Doobie Snax.

INT. VAN--WEED VISION

As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky
(with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze,
we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling
about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken
off to reveal a man inside a costume.

Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint
and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total
debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy
cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish
and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.
The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--

GREAT DANE
Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob

The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking
way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-
eyed.

JAY
Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's
got a stoner-boner!!!

Jay and Bob smile and pass out.

We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to
Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.

BEAUTY
I think they passed out.

GUY
Great. What do we do with them now?

DUDE
Let's cut out their kidneys to sell
on the black market and leave them
in a seedy motel bathtub full of
ice.

BOOKISH
Oh God, not again?

INT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT

Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar
on his back.

EXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY

Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as
well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see
the scar. It's not there.

JAY
Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.
(looks around)
Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get
some breakfast?

Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,
and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.

EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY

An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob
enter.

INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME

As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public
INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.

JAY
Yo--check that shit out: the Internet.
Let's see if those fucks said
something new about us and that stupid
flick.

Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar
and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look
at the screen and go wide-eyed.

JAY
""Any movie based on Jay and Silent
Bob is gonna lick balls, because
they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely
each other's.""

Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.

JAY
Eww.
(reading further)
""Yes--they are real people. Real
stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.""
(to Bob)
Motherfucker! It's time we wrote
something back! Type this shit down.

Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.

JAY
All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.
You are the ones who are the ball-
lickers.  We're gonna fuck your
mothers whole you watch and cry like
little bitches. Once we get to
Hollywood and find those Miramax
fucks who are making the movie, we're
gonna make 'em eat our shit, then
shit our shit, then eat their shit
which is made of our shit that we
made 'em eat. Then all you
motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay
and Silent Bob.

Silent Bob finishes typing and presses ""Return"". He and Jay
nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking
up at the menu board.

JAY
That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat
our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get
back on the road, get to Hollywood,
and stop that fucking movie from
getting made. No more hairy-bush
nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye
on the prize, and not let nothing--
and I mean NOTHING--distract me.

As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and
freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all
in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in
the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.

She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.

Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then
at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's
eyes, getting zero response.

JAY'S POV

The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to
her breasts, then down to her crotch.

Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle
of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss
on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager
to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous
with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.

But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to
Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls
his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it
over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She
smiles at the zombified Jay.

GIRL
(off cup)
Oh my God. Do you get free refills
with that?

JAY
Oh, what--this? I just wear this for
protection. You know--so no guys try
to grab my shit.

GIRL
Hi. I'm Justice.

JAY
(dreamily)
And I am so fucking yours--

Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.

JAY
I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my
hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.

JUSTICE
It's nice to meet you.

JAY
Justice, hunh? That's a nice name.
(under his breath, to
Bob)
Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-
U-C-K-I-N-G--
(back to Justice)
So you come here often?

JUSTICE
Oh, I'm not from around here. My
friends and I are taking a road trip,
and we just stopped to grab something
to eat.

JAY
Your friends, hunh? Where they at?

JUSTICE
(pointing)
Out there. By that van.

Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other
gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair
around, looking incredibly sexy.

Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--

JAY
Dude--I think I just filled the cup.

INT. VAN--DAY

Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the
other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food
to her friends.

JAY
Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent
Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!

SISSY
Who the fuck are these guys?

JUSTICE
This is Jay and Silent Bob.
(to Jay and Bob)
Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and
Chrissy.

CHRISSY
Where the fuck did they come from?

JUSTICE
I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch
a ride.

SISSY
I don't know if that's such a great
idea. Jussy.

JAY
Sure it is, Juggs.

MISSY
Oh my god--he just called Sissy
""Juggs""!

CHRISSY
I'm on it.

Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.

JUSTICE
Chrissy, no!

Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.

SISSY
We're in the middle of suburbia,
Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.

CHRISSY

}


.



And what-stupid ass little foul-
mouthed bitch-boys don't get their
balls cut off in suburbia?

JAY
(oblivious)
What's with the knife? We having
cake or something?

CHRISSY
Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.

JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Yo--she called you retarded.

SISSY
(to Justice)
What's wrong with you, Justice? You
do remember where we're going, don't
you?

MISSY
That we do have a job to do?

JUSTICE
They're just gonna tag along for a
few miles. They won't get in the
way, I promise.
(cutesy)
Please?

SISSY
Fine--they can ride with us. But
they're so out of here before we get
to Boulder.

JUSTICE
Honest Injun.

CHRISSY
""Honest Injun""?
(to Sissy)
I can't believe what a pushover you
are.

JAY
And I can't believe fine-ass bitches
like yourselves eat that shit. Don't
you know fast food makes girls fart?

Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting
into the van.

BRENT
Say--what's all this talk about
farting?

Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to
sweet and airy, totally switching characters.

SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY
Hi Brent!

SISSY
This is Brent. He's with us, too.

CHRISSY
Brent, tell these sillies that girls
don't fart.

BRENT
Of course they don't! Only skeevy
stoners fart.

The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay
and Silent Bob.

BRENT
What up, homies?
(off the Girls)
Wow, Three guys, four girls--
(to Jay and Bob)
What's the count boys?

Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.

INT. VAN--DAY

Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and
Bob listen, rolling eyes.

BRENT
Hey there mister science-guy. Don't
spray that aerosol in my eye. For I
don't really want to die. I'm a noble
rabbit!

JAY
What're you guys, like a cover band
or something?

SISSY
We're the Kansas State chapter of
S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal
Cruelty.

CHRISSY
And we're on our way to Colorado to
give Provasik a piece of our minds!

Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.

JAY
What the fuck are you bitches babbling
about?

BRENT
Hey! Watch the language little boy.
There are females present.

Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts
them.

JUSTICE
Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical
lab where they perform gross
experiments on animals.

JAY
So, what kind of animals are we
talking about here--like bears and
rhinos?

BRENT
No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...
heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak
for them, who will?
(touches Justice's
arm)
Right, Jussy?

Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After
a beat, he relaxes.

JAY
Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you
over here for a second?

Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him
confidentially.

JAY
Be honest, yo--you're down with this
for the fine-ass pussy, right?

BRENT
I'm down with this because I love
animals, stupid.

JAY
Even sheep?

BRENT
Of course. Sheep are beautiful
creatures.

JAY
They are beautiful, aren't they?

BRENT
Oh God, yes.

JAY
So then you'd fuck a sheep?

BRENT
What is your damage little boy? You've
got a sick and twisted world
perspective.

JAY
No, you misunderstand me, Prince
Valiant. I mean if you were another
sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if
you were another sheep?

BRENT
I--suppose so.

JAY
That's what I thought.
(suddenly loudly, to
all)
YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF
US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled
out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as
well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.

JAY
YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!

EXT. HIGHWAY--LATER

The van drives down the road.

INT. VAN--SAME

Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels
between them.

CHRISSY
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

SISSY
Shut up, I'm thinking.

In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her,
and she quickly folds them up.

JAY
Is Hollywood near where we're going?

JUSTICE
Is that where you guys are from?

JAY
Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!

JUSTICE
Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you
all the way out here?

JAY
Well, we couldn't hang in front of
the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of
the strainen-en order, which sucks
ass 'cause it's been like our home
since we were kids. Silent Bob even
busted his cherry there.

JUSTICE
(to Bob)
You did? I'll bet she was a lucky
girl.

Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has
strayed.

JAY
Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying
to tell a story here.

JUSTICE
Sorry.

JAY
Anyway, we were talking to Brodie
and he said there's gonna be a
Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we
went to see Holden McNeil, and he
showed us the Internet, and that's
where we found all these fucking
little jerkoffs were saying shit
about us. So we decided to go to
Hollywood and stop the movie from
getting made.  And now we're here.

JUSTICE
Wow. I have no idea what you just
said.

JAY
Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like
animals, huh?

JUSTICE
Sure.

JAY
That's cool. Even snakes?

JUSTICE
You can't exclude an animal just
because it's not cuddly. Of course I
like snakes.

JAY
How about trouser snakes?

JUSTICE
What's a trouser snake?

Just then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.

JAY DEVIL
(to Jay)
What the fuck are you waiting for?
She went for the setup! Reach in
your fucking pants, and pull yer
cock out, bitch! That's the kinda
shit girls like!

Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right
shoulder.

JAY DEVIL 2
Right about here's where the angel's
supposed to show up and tell you not
to pull your dick out. But we bitch-
slapped that little fuck and sent
him packing, so it's smooth sailing.
Let 'er rip, boy!

They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his
hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick,
when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder,
rubbing a swollen jaw.

JAY ANGEL
Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal
here?
(looks down)
Oh, shit--you're not thinking of
whipping your dick out at this fine
piece of woman, are you?

Jay thinks, then nods ""Yes."" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes,
and slaps him.

JAY ANGEL
Tell you what: look at Silent Bob.
See if he thinks it's a good idea to
whip your dick out.

Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in
his pants to Jay and shakes his head ""no,"" sternly. Jay
withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods,
satisfied.

JAY ANGEL
That's it, boy--put the dick down.
You gotta go from the heart, yo. No
little perv bullshit will do for
this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de
la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the
shit out of two suckerpunching little
bitches. Remember--don't pull your
dick out until she asks you to.
(beat)
Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!
The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice
looks at Jay, a bit confused.

JAY
Don't ask.
(beat)
So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like
me do to help the animals?

JUSTICE
You really don't want to help us--

JAY
What the fuck are you talking about?
Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

Justice smiles. Jay tries to recover.

JAY
I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything
for youse guys. For the lift and
shit.

JUSTICE
You sure?

JAY
Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.
Fuck

JUSTICE
Well--okay. Let me talk it over with
the other girls and get back to you.

JAY
You do that.

Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.

JAY
I'll be right here.

He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the
can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and
winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly,
then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.

JAY
Fuck you. Fatty.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY

The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls
head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent
Bob.

JUSTICE
You guys want anything from inside?

JAY
No, we're cool, thanks hon.

Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study
the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a
place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.
After a beat--

JAY
It just ain't the same, is it? This
place licks balls compared to Quick
Stop.

Silent Bob shakes his head ""Yeah.""

JAY
And speaking of licking balls--how
'bout that Justice chick? She is too
fine.  And she smells so fucking
pretty. She's got a nice voice, too.
And that body?  Smoking. You know,
she never once said ""fuck off,"" when
I was talking to her, or pulled out
the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell
ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded
by the other girls.

MISSY
Smooth move, Justice.

CHRISSY
(slapping Justice
upside the head)
Nice going, Four Eyes!

JUSTICE
Ow!

SISSY
Why the fuck did you let that little
stoner throw Brent our of the van?!

JUSTICE
Oh please--if I had to listen to one
more of those stupid songs, I was
going to throw him out myself.

SISSY
We needed Brent, Justice! He was our
patsy!

JUSTICE
We'll find someone else. Besides, I
didn't see you trying to stop Jay
from throwing him out.

SISSY
Because I didn't want to blow our
cover!

JUSTICE
Cover, shmover--you all hated his
songs, too.

CHRISSY
Not as much as I hate you.

Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance,

CHRISSY
Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone
soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!

SISSY
(rubbing Chrissy's
shoulders)
Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a
little too wound for sound.

CHRISSY
Then how about you help me take the
edge off?

Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot
and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other
customers regard them wide-eyed.

JUSTICE
(to Customers)
They're really good friends.

SISSY
(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)
Would you two knock it off? We're in
the fucking heartland here! Try to
blend!

JUSTICE
They already do--she's the milkmaid,
and she's the cow.

CHRISSY
Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,
bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your
head off and fuck your spine stump.

SISSY
Enough!
(calm to Justice)
We have a very simple gang here,
Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's
the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl.
But lately, I'm having a hard time
figuring out what you're doing here.

JUSTICE
That makes two of us.

CHRISSY
Shit--your name doesn't even fit the
rhyme scheme.

JUSTICE
That's because very few names rhyme
with ""douchebag.""

CHRISSY
(getting in her face)
You're dancing on my last nerve,
Strawberry Shortcake.
(to Sissy)
You deal with the weak link. I'm
gonna take Missy into the dirty
convenience store bathroom and hate-
fuck the shit out of her.

Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.

JUSTICE
And you said letting them read all
that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to
anything.

SISSY
Don't change the subject. You know
what you have to do now, right? Since
you let our patsy slip away, you've
gotta convince the little kid and
that fat guy to take his place.
They've gotta break into Provasik
now.

JUSTICE
Uh-uh!

SISSY
Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out
of this gang. Just use the little
one's crush to convince him, since
he's so fucking in love with you.

JUSTICE
Jay? No he's not.

SISSY
What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing
your hand back in the van like he
was fucking Lord Byron?

JUSTICE
Well, maybe he was just raised with
manners.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.

JAY
(to exited Girl)
YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE
LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!
(to Bob)
Yeah.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

Sissy continues to confront Justice.

SISSY
You're the one that brought the kid
in, Jussy. So you've gotta make
amends.

JUSTICE
Jay is not taking Brent's place as
the patsy.

SISSY
That kid and his quite friend are
our only options at this point. Now
we got about two hours before we get
to Boulder. That gives you plenty of
of time to work on him.

JUSTICE
I'm not gonna do it.

SISSY
Why the fuck not?

JUSTICE
Because he's just to so innocent!

Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing
alongside Bob.

JUSTICE
Look at him--

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to
Silent Bob.

JAY
I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little
asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my
balls--in her mouth! Where? Where?
In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her
mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls--

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.

SISSY
Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or
us?

Justice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks
back out at Jay.

INT. VAN--DAY

Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.

JAY
Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.

JUSTICE
It's not really stealing--it's
liberating it, and--
(finally hears him)
Wait a second--did you say, ""No
problem""?

JAY
Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the
time.
(to Bob)
Right, Lunchbox?

Silent Bob glares at Jay.

JUSTICE
It's not like it's a bad thing. It's
for a good cause.

JAY
Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--
(takes her hand)
The cause of love.
(kisses her hand,
then releases)
Snoogans--

JUSTICE
What the heck is that?

JAY
What's what?

JUSTICE
""Snoogans,"" I believe it was.

JAY
What the fuck do you think it means?
It means ""I'm kidding.""

JUSTICE
Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.

She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front
of the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then
humps silent Bob's leg like a dog.

JAY
(singing)
I can't believe I'm gonna get some
pussy for stealing a monkey!
(speaking)
If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've
been stealing monkeys since I was
like seven and shit.

Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.

JAY
Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin
this for me. Me and Justice are gonna
get married one day, so don't be
giving me that ""we-ain't-stealing-no-
monkey"" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're
Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that.
That girl? That girl's in love with
me.

Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.

JUSTICE
They're gonna do it.

SISSY
Good. They do their part--
(pats a video camera)
And we'll do ours.

Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs,
parking in front of another large building.

INT. VAN--SAME

Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear
Ninja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.

JUSTICE
Remember--we meet back here when
you're done. You sure you're okay
with this?

JAY
As sure as I am that you're the
hottest bitch I ever seen.

Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy
away.

JAY
What's twisting that bitch's tits?

JUSTICE
Maybe it's because women don't like
to be called ""bitches,"" Jay.

JAY
They don't? Well how 'bout ""piece of
ass""?

JUSTICE
How about not.

JAY
Well, what the fuck am I supposed to
call you, then?

JUSTICE
Something sweet, you big goof.
Something nice.

JAY
(thinks; then)
Boo-boo kitty fuck.

JUSTICE
(laughing)
Okay.  That's a start.

Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming
it at Jay and Bob.

SISSY
Jay, before you go, could you say
something into the camera about the
clitoris.

JAY
What?

JUSTICE
(to Sissy)
Man you are such a bitch--

SISSY
(off Justice; to Jay)
She's just a little embarrassed.
See, Jussy and I are putting together
this documentary for our Human
Sexuality class, and we need a male
perspective on the clitoris.

JAY
The female clitoris?

SISSY
Uh--yeah.

JUSTICE
Jay, you don't have to do this.

She elbows Sissy.

JAY
Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few
things I can say about the clit that
I's like you to hear.
(clears throat; into
camera)
I am the master of the clit! I make
that shit work! It does what ever
the fuck I tell it to do!  No one
rules the clit like me!
(off Silent Bob)
Not this little fuck! None of you
little fucks out there! I am the
clit commander!!! Remember that--
commander of all clits!

Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes
her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.

SISSY
Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.

Sissy climbs back into the van.

JAY
(to Justice)
So--can I get a little kiss for good
luck?

Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.

JAY
So--can I get a little blow job for
good luck?

Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off,
revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in
midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out.
Justice watches them go.

SISSY
Jussy. C'mon.

Justice climbs back into the van.

INT. VAN--SAME

Justice sits, glaring at Sissy.

SISSY
Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my
authority again, you lose your fucking
fronts, you got that?

JUSTICE
Yes, sir.

Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to
Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment.

SISSY
Phase One, down. While we're executing
Phase Two, you edit that tape and
grab a new car.

MISSY
No sweat.

SISSY
Let's suit up.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,
stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN
out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly
gives the ""metal"" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.

INT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

It's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a
window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja
hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.

JAY
You fat fuck--

INT. VAN--NIGHT

Missy peers through binoculars out the window.

SISSY
They in?

MISSY
You can say that.

SISSY
Time to shine. Let's go.

EXT. VAN--NIGHT

The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look
at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black.
They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front
door.

Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures
elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers
Sissy a look.

JUSTICE
You are so gay.

Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a
digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four
different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.

SISSY
Once we're inside, I want complete
silence.
(holding up high-tech
device)
Missy whipped this up. It counts our
decibel level. If it goes into the
red--alarm, we're dead. So not even
the slightest noise, got it?

Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed
closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one
last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay
and Bob.

SISSY
(pokes her head back
out)
Justice! Move your ass!

Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads:
BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.

INT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT

Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.

It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking
ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his
eyes and hits him.

JAY
Stay frosty, you big fucking softie.
We've got a job to do.

Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade
through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on
the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.

JAY
Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal
tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up
like Percocets!

Jay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and
tosses it to Bob.

JAY
Hold this. Later, me and Justice can
shoot each other with it and fuck
like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.

Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The
pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND
OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage
from where the sound emitted. He smiles.

JAY
(reading)
""Suzanne."" Boo-yah.

INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the
other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.

Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays
the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor,
which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly,
within the mist, laser beams become apparent.

Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few
steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs
forward and does an impressive series of flips down the
hallway, not touching a single laser beam.

Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of
the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture
to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series
of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.

Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to
Chrissy.

Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,
Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.

Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are
even more impressive than the other two, including running
up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes
the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice,
arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud,
manly FART.

The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING
through the building.

CHRISSY
Holy fuck--the little stoner was
right--

Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours
them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed
by Justice and Chrissy.

EXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy
pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.

CHRISSY
Boom Box!

Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races
toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the
convertible.

SISSY
I can't believe it. Months of planning
and it's all blown by a fucking fart.

JUSTICE
We can't just leave them like this!
That alarm's gonna bring the cops
here any minute!

SISSY
That was always the plan, Justice!
They take the heat off of is long
enough until we can get out of town!

Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.

CHRISSY
Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.

The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into
the car with them.

CHRISSY
It's set. Let's roll.

The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there.
The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting
down from two minutes.

INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT

Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something
seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent
bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the
cages. Jay hits him.

JAY
What the fuck are you looking at?
There ain't no snacks here, man! Now
we got what we came for, so let's
get the fuck out!

Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes
his head frustrated.

JAY
Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck
are we supposed to do about it?

Silent bob offers Jay a look.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob
(carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs,
birds, rabbits. All race off into the night.

Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.

JUSTICE
JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!

Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.

JAY
Oh shit--

Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and
Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay
looks to Bob, pissed

COP
DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS
EXPLOSIVE!

The counter on the device attached to the van hits ""0,"" and
the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one
direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks
at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.

JAY
Justice--

We crane up from him as he bellows--

JAY
JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!

Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still
carrying the bag.

EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife
Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY
opening the door and heading inside.

INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an
operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go
wide.

DEPUTY
Oh, fudge...
(calling off)
Marshal Willenholly!

INT. BATHROOM--SAME

MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged
Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks
off.

WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby--
It takes two hands to hold doesn't
it--?  Uhhh--

As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.

WILLENHOLLY
WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!

DEPUTY (O.S.)
Sir, we got a report of a break-in
at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing
lab.

Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine.
There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.

WILLENHOLLY
Have you read this article on the
mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I
wish that was in our jurisdiction--
I'd shut down every last one of those
ass-cock chuggers, personally.

The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then
at Willenholly.

WILLENHOLLY
What? ""Ass"" means ""donkey.""

DEPUTY
Yes, sir.
(hands him a fax)

WILLENHOLLY
(looks at fax)
Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.

DEPUTY
We don't have a jet, sir. And
Boulder's only ten minutes away.

WILLENHOLLY
Then gas up the next best thing.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY

There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out
van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly
pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.

WILLENHOLLY
My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats
out?
(thinks)
Wait--is that right?

COP 1 (O.S.)
Excuse me--who the hell are you?

Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket,
revealing a badge.

WILLENHOLLY
Federal Wildlife Marshal. This
investigation is now under my
jurisdiction.

COP 1
Oh really? And why is that?

WILLENHOLLY
Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.

COP 1
Well, we believe that was just a
diversionary tactic used to call
attention away from the real heist
over here at the Diamond Exchange.

WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, right. That's a believable
scenario. It sounds more like
something out of a bad movie.

Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another
COP joins them.

COP 2
Sir, the Provasik people say they've
rounded all their animals up, except
for one: an orangutan.

WILLENHOLLY
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our
fugitive has been on the run for 6
hours!  Average simian foot speed
over uneven ground--barring injuries
or preoccupation with tire tubes,
mites or bananas--is four miles an
hour. That gives us a radius of twenty
miles.

COP 3
(calling out from
crowd)
Twenty-four, sir!

WILLENHOLLY
What?

COP 3
Six hours times four miles an hour
is twenty-four.

WILLENHOLLY
(doing the math in
his head)
Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-
four miles. Now what I want out of
all of you is a hard target search.

COP 4
Excuse me, sir?

WILLENHOLLY
Yeah?

COP 4
What does that mean, exactly--a ""hard
target search""? What's a ""hard
target""?

WILLENHOLLY
Well. It's--a target--that's--hard.
Anyway--

COP 4
So are you referring to the search's
level of difficulty? Or is the hard
target the monkey?

COP 3
Or the people who stole the monkey?

The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of
""Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,""etc.
Willenholly rubs his temples.

WILLENHOLLY
Okay, how about this? What I want
out of all of you is a thorough search
of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse, and doghouse in that area!
Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!

COP 1
Wouldn't it make sense to put them
up at every twenty-four miles--seeing
as that's how far they'd have gotten
in the last six hours?

They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly
looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.

WILLENHOLLY
This is so frustrating. It's just so
hard sometimes--
(yelling)
YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO
FIND HER!

Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.

COP 5
Sir, this was just delivered to the
station.

WILLENHOLLY
What is it?

COP 5
It's a tape from the terrorists who're
claiming credit for the break-in.

WILLENHOLLY
Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--
never mind. Do you have a VCR?

INT. OFFICE--DAY

Willenholly and the Cops stare at the O.C. TV, shocked, as
the video ends.

WILLENHOLLY
Oh my God--
(without looking up)
Have the jet gassed up and ready to
go at a moment's notice.

COP
Sir, we don't have a jet; just a
helicopter.

WILLENHOLLY
(dialing his cell
phone)
Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore?
(into cell phone)
Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta
get me on the national news, pronto.
Why?!  Because we may very well be
dealing with the two most dangerous
men on the planet!

EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at--

SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them,
staring back.

JAY
This is Jussy's monkey
(to Suzanne, angrily)
JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY
FUCK!

Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and
Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and
pulling back as if he's going to strike.

JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Do something. Tons of Fun!

Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her
hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to
see over silent Bob.

JAY
Is that fucking thing waving at us?

Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at
the ape.

JAY
Holy shit? That monkey understood
us! Maybe it's some sort of super-
monkey!

Suzanne offer them a ""raspberry."" Spitting as if the comment
was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at
this.

JAY
What the fuck was that for? It's not
a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?

Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, ""Congo stunk."" Silent
Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him,
stung.

JAY
You're my bitch. You get my back.
Don't go joining this chimp's side.

Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent
Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.

JAY
Yo--what if there's more super monkeys
up in the lab? Maybe they're making
an army of 'em up there! Holy shit!
Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the
X-Files Roswell--style!

JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--

INT. LAB--DAY

We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids
in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching
blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes
hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which
looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.

JAY (V.O.)
Working in secret with a crew of
double-dealing, nicotine-fiending
fucks that're selling out the human
race, these supermonkeys will use
simian science and their genius IQ's
to make man and monkey alike believe
that they're the superior species!

EXT. BALCONY--DAY

A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of
apes, who wave fists in the air.

JAY (V.O.)
Then all it'll take is one little
monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the
dumber chimps into a frenzy, until
they go all ape-shit and start
demanding more bananas, better pay,
and human flesh!

EXT. FIELD--DAY

Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield,
and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA
on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net
over him.

JAY (V.O.)
You'll have to be faster than Walt
Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior
gorillas, who hunt humans for sport,
profit, and the occasional inter-
species blow-job. And if you don't
wind up with a monkey hog in your
mouth, you'll be captured, killed or
worse...

INT. LAB--DAY

Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a
living, screaming, Dante.

JAY (V.O.)
Eaten alive!

EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like
atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of
bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop

JAY (V.O.)
Then these monkey fucks'll start
wearing our clothes and rebuilding
the world in their image.

EXT. BEACH--DAY

We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up,
then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach
buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.

JAY (V.O.)
And only those who outwit those damn
dirty apes'll ever remember that it
was MAN who once ruled the earth!

JAY
(at statue)
YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN
YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!

WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:

EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne
and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne
angrily.

JAY
Not on my watch, motherfucker!

Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.

JAY
DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!

Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the
dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers,
and kisses him on the lips.

JAY
Alright--you can live. For now.

Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.

JAY
You see that? Bitches love me.
(heading off)
Besides--we're in the fucking clear,
yo. It's not like anyone knows we
stole the monkey.

INT. TV NEWS STATION--DAY

An ANCHORMAN addresses the camera.

ANCHORMAN
I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News
Now bulletin. A Provasik animal
testing facility in boulder was the
focus of an attack by a terroristic
primate rescue syndicate calling
themselves the Coalition for
Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers.
Or simply, C.L.I.T.

A graphic of the C.L.I.T. logo appears beside him, nailing
home the joke.

ANCHORMAN
In a videotape sent to authorities
this morning, credit for the
liberation of an orangutan from the
lab last night is taken by these men--

A VIDEO CAPTURE of JAY and SILENT BOB from pre-break--in
appears on screen.

ANCHORMAN
--identified in literature that
accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent
Bob. In this chilling clip, they
make it very clear that they are in
control of the C.L.I.T.

On screen is the C.L.I.T. Logo. A digitized voice narrates.

DIGITIZED VOICE
We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are
safe. Now tremble before the might
of our merciless leader.

The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy
shot before the Provasik break-in. Jay's yelling into the
camera.

JAY
I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!

Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his
head, chilled.

ANCHORMAN
Terrifying. Here to help us understand
this footage is Federal Wildlife
Marshal Willenholly.

PULL OUT to reveal Willenholly beside the Anchorman.

ANCHORMAN
Marshal, what can you tell us about
the C.L.I.T.?

WILLENHOLLY
From the intelligence we've been
able to gather, we've discovered
that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot
of the L.A.B.I.A.

ANCHORMAN
The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning
Apes movement.

WILLENHOLLY
Exactly. The men you saw in the video
are believed to be the masterminds
responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T.
activity last night. They go by the
obvious code names ""Jay"" and ""Silent
Bob.""
(to camera)
If you should come across them or
any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please--
exercise extreme caution.

INT. POTZEK'S INC. OFFICE--NIGHT

On the TV screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay
and Silent Bob.  Holden looks up from his drawing table,
shocked.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
(from TV)
Marshal, how do you respond to
allegations that Federal Wildlife
Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T.
to slip through their fingers?

WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T.,
Reg.

HOLDEN
(shakes his head)
Nights like this, I miss dating a
lesbian.

INT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT

From behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV,
slack-jawed.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
(from TV)
Is there also speculation that Jay
and Silent bob may be responsible
for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist
that occurred in the same vicinity
of downtown Boulder last night?

WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
There's nothing to suggest that, no.
But these men are still to be
considered very dangerous.

RANDAL
(to Dante)
I told you that restraining order
was a good idea.

EXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME

On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel,
Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink
champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans
against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report
on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.

ANCHORMAN
(on TV)
Is that your cell phone?

WILLENHOLLY
(on TV)
Yes, Excuse me.
(on TV, into cell
phone)
Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my
way!
(shuts phone; to
anchorman)
We got 'em. They're in Utah.
(to camera)
Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the
C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T.
is not recommended.

Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.

JUSTICE
Your tape worked. The news is all
about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik
break-in, with almost no mention of
the Diamond heist.

SISSY
(yelling down to
Justice)
I told you those two were the perfect
patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--
just in case--and start planning the
next job.

JUSTICE
Don't you feel any regret? Jay and
Bob don't deserve this. They were
really sweet.

CHRISSY
The only thing I regret is not gutting
that little trout-mouthed prick like
a fish and playing Twister with his
vitals.

MISSY
You are so nasty.

CHRISSY
I'll show you nasty, you little slut.

SISSY
Would you two get a room?

CHRISSY
Fine--we'll take yours.
(getting up in Sissy's
face)
I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-
otch.

Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls
her eyes.

SISSY
Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.

JUSTICE
They're your gang.

SISSY
Oh and not yours? You know, I don't
get you, Justice. You used to be all
about the girl stuff: stealing,
boning, blowing shit up. Now you're
like this little priss with a
conscience. It's really a fucking
drag.

JUSTICE
We all gotta grow up some time.

SISSY
If moping around over some little
boy you're crushing on is being grown-
up, then pass me my Wonder Woman
underoos.

JUSTICE
Don't you feel the least bit of guilt
for what we did to those guys?

SISSY
Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty
about setting up her boyfriend? Then
how about taking a shower?

Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace.
They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY
GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
You the gals that ordered the pizzas?

SISSY
This dopey bitch ordered the large
plain, but I could go for some hot,
thick, Sicilian.

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
No charge, lady.  He rushes into the
motel, Justice sighs, looking up at
the stars.

JUSTICE
(quietly)
I'm sorry, Jay.

INT. DINER--DAY

Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay
chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne
digs into a banana split.

JAY
You know, Justice died trying to
save this monkey, so maybe we should
keep her around. That way, we can
honor her memory.

Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their
food.

JAY
Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing
all sentimental, and you're all about
a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't
you glad we stopped to eat?  And you
were all piss-scared the cops'd bust
us or something. You know what I
say?
(singing, a la NWA)

VOICE (O.S.)
(via bullhorn)
THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE
KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER
THE ORANGUTAN!

Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then--

JAY
You think they're talking to us?

EXT. DINER--DAY

There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling
at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other
COPS.

SHERIFF
YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.
(to other COPS)
Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.

Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind
the car, gun drawn.

SHERIFF
The ape.

WILLENHOLLY
What?

SHERIFF
An orangutan's a member of the great
ape family. It's not a monkey.

WILLENHOLLY
Look, who's the Federal Wildlife
Marshal here?
(into bullhorn)
JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL
WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR
C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.
SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY,
AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!

INT. DINER--DAY

Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth,
like scared rats.

JAY
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Go out there and give 'em the monkey.

Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked.

JAY
Oh, what, man? I said that shit before
I knew they were gonna shoot us!
Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't
takin' no bullet for no monkey!

Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay
rolls his eyes.

JAY
Oh, brother--this is like something
out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe
it's not that bad back at the lab!
Maybe they experiment on 'em by,
like making 'em fuck a bunch of
different, good-looking monkeys. We
don't know! Maybe they got it real
sweet!

Suzanne shakes her head ""no."" Bob points to her, as if she's
strengthening his point.

JAY
(to Suzanne)
You stay out of this, you weepy little
chimp!
(looks around thinking)
Fuck man, I ain't no strategist!
You're the guy that makes the
blueprints! I don't even have the
fucking smarts of a little--

Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's
a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded
sweatshirt and a baseball cap.

JAY
--kid

EXT. DINER--DAY

Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The
Sheriff looks on.

WILLENHOLLY
ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY
BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO
OPEN FIRE!
(to cops)
Everyone has bullets in their guns,
right?

Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between
them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed
up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the
diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.
It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.

JAY
Don't shoot! We're just trying to
take our son out of this hostile
environment!

From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.

SHERIFF
Their ""son""?

WILLENHOLLY
Maybe they're one of those gay
couples?

Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.

JAY
Yeah! We're gay! And this is our
adopted love child! We're not from
around here!  Don't make us go back
to our liberal city home with a tales
of prejudice and bigotry in the heart
of Utah!
(whispers to Bob)
You see the shit I gotta put up with
for you! Now I got this guy thinking
I'm gay!

WILLENHOLLY
Oh God, this is the last thing I
need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals
shooting their mouth off in the
liberal press that the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes
gays.

SHERIFF
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY
BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON!
THAT'S THE APE!

WILLENHOLLY
You see this badge?  I think I'd
recognize an ape if I saw one. And
the only thing I do recognize here
is a political fiasco I'm, going to
avoid by letting this butt-fucking
Brady Bunch go!

Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--

JAY
And I'll tell you another thing:
what if that guy shows up around the
stores one day and starts telling
everybody you and me are poo-gilists?
How are we gonna get any pussy then,
hunh?

WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)
YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!

Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look
back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at
himself, as if to say, ""Me?""

WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
YES, YOU, SIRS.

JAY
(calling over)
So we can just go?

WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my
apologies for detaining you and your
unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
protected-family unit.

SHERIFF
(amazed)
Un-fucking believable.

JAY
I'd like to offer a big gay thank-
you, sir. We'll tell all our gay
friends that Utah is Gay friendly
country for gays who are gay.

WILLENHOLLY
I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You
might also want to make it clear
that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's
Office is also pro-'mo as well.
(winks at the sheriff)
And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.

JAY
Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm.
See, I knocked up a hot woman friend
of ours who I also fuck on the side.
So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But
my tubby husband here is one hundred
percent queer. He loves the cock.

WILLENHOLLY
He certainly looks insatiable.

JAY
'Bye

WILLENHOLLY
'Bye

Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road.
Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.

WILLENHOLLY
Well, it's not my way--but damned if
there doesn't go one happy family.
(balloon two)
Now, we just shoot some tear gas
into that diner, and when the two
guys run out with the monkey, we'll--

Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the
Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY
That was the them, wasn't it?

EXT. ROAD--DAY

Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.

JAY
I said you ""love the cock""! I gotta
be the craftiest motherfucker alive!

GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now
in full panic mode.

Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.

Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.

JAY
FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't),
shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at
it, screaming.

JAY
HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!

Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all
around them, Jay leaps into the manhole.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL

Jay lands in a sewer tunnel (like in The Fugitive). Suzanne
lands on top of him.

JAY
Take your stinking paws off me, you
damn dirty ape!
(yelling up)
YO LUNCHBOX! HURRY UP!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives
into the sewer grate as well, but--

INT. SEWER TUNNEL

Silent Bob gets stuck. Jay rolls his eyes.

JAY
You fat fuck.

Silent Bob struggles while Jay and Suzanne try to pull him
through the hole.

JAY
You just--had to--order pancakes--
didn't ya?

EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

CLOSER on the running Willenholly and Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY
Fire a warning shot into that bulbous
ass!

SHERIFF
One rectal breach, coming up!

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

Jay and Suzanne pull with all their might. Bob strains.

JAY
SUCK IT IN! THINK THIN! THINK THIN!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

TIGHT on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim.

SHERIFF
Open up and say ""ahhhhh,"" you stoner
sumbitch--

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

TIGHT on Silent Bob bellowing.

SILENT BOB
AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

The Sheriff's gun fires.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

Jay and Suzanne fall backwards, as Silent Bob pops through.

JAY
INCOMING!!!

SILENT BOB
AAAIIIGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!

SUZANNE
OOOOOOOOO!!!

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip
through.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne are in various states of
collapse. Jay and Bob look up at the hole.

JAY
Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole.

WILLENHOLLY
Wow! That was an incredibly daring
escape!
(to Sheriff)
You must see that a lot, hunh?

SHERIFF
Shut up!

WILLENHOLLY
Sire, you're very taciturn.

Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff
looks on.

WILLENHOLLY
You and your men stay up here. When
I corner them, I'll call you for
back-up.

SHERIFF
What're you doing? They're trapped.
The only way they can get out of
there is right here.

WILLENHOLLY
A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't
wait for his prey to come to him. He
comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it
""comes to it"" or ""goes to it""?
(shakes it off)
I'm going in there. I'm counting on
you Sheriff.

Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY
You've taught me so much.

Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The
Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--

SHERIFF
Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to
the station and get some donuts.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

TIGHT on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance,
bathed by natural light. We HEAR the loud sounds of water
rushing.

JAY
This reminds me of the night I fucked
your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly,
gaping hole, and me wishing I had a
board tied to my ass--

PULL BACK to reveal Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne standing at
the precipice of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a DAM.
Water rushed below.

JAY
--to keep from falling in.

WILLENHOLLY
PUT THE MONKEY DOWN AND YOUR HANDS
UP!

Willenholly aims his gun at the trio's backs.

WILLENHOLLY
MISTERS, DO YOU WANNA GET SHOT?!?

Our heroes comply, but Jay speaks.

JAY
LOOK MAN--SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO
BACK! THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING ON HER!
(beat)
AND FOR THE RECORD, I AIN'T REALLY
GAY!

WILLENHOLLY
I DON'T CARE!
(beat)
AND FOR THE RECORD, I KNEW THAT WASN'T
REALLY A LITTLE BOY.

JAY
SURE, FOR ONE MORE RECORD--
(pointing to Silent
Bob)
HE LOVES COCK!

WILLENHOLLY
ON YOUR KNEES!

Jay and Silent Bob face Willenholly and kneel. But Suzanne's
still looking out of the dam.

JAY
See, man?! He's lining us up like
fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going
first--I don't want no mouthful of
monkey-spit when I gotta blow this
fucking G-Man.

TIGHT on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water
below. Her brow hardens with purpose.

TIGHT on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand.

TIGHT on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand.

Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob
backwards.

JAY
GET OFFA ME!!! GET OFFA ME!!!

EXT. DAM--DAY

Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and
Bob with her.

JAY AND BOB
AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!

INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

Willenholly goes wide-eyed, holstering his gun.

WILLENHOLLY
Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter
Pan on me?!

He races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as
well.

WILLENHOLLY
AAAIIIGGGGHHHHH!!!

EXT. DAM--DAY

As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her
feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the
tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent
Bob's hands.

JAY
HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--
SMOKER!!!

EXT. DAM BOTTOM--DAY

Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes
into the drink.

EXT. DAM--DAY

Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of
the tunnel.

JAY
You see that shit? Damn--remind me
not to get on the monkey's bad side.
Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so
we can get the fuck out of here.

Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the--

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

--pavement near the manhole. She sits there, looking down.

EXT. DAM--DAY

Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the
road,

EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the
shot.

Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway
just in time to see--

The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates
and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is
looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to
their feet, chasing after the truck.

JAY
HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!

The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob
stand there, panting.

JAY
Man! Who the fuck just steals a
monkey?!

Silent Bob indicates themselves.

JAY
Oh yeah.
(pissed)
Well this fucking blows! We got one
more day to stop those fucks from
making that movie, and someone goes
and takes the only thing I had left
from the one woman I ever loved enough
NOT to try to stick my hand down her
pants!

Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.

JAY
Go after the monkey? How the fuck
are we supposed to know where that
thing's going?

Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares
at him.

JAY
What? What is that supposed to mean?!
Don't just fucking point like--
(imitates him)
You ain't the broad in the Children
of a Lesser God. Use you fucking
mouth for more than eating, ya tubby
bitch!

Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what
he's saying.

JAY
You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta
take a salad? Take a salad? What the
fuck are you trying to say?

Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message.

JAY
JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?

Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face.

SILENT BOB
THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID
CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB
FUCK!!!

Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the
direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat,
then follows, muttering under his breath--

JAY
Say it, don't spray it, bitch.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT.

SHERIFF (O.S.)
""And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.""

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY

The Sheriff and his men stand around, eating donuts, laughing.
The Station doors slam open, and Willenholly enters, soaking
wet. All the Cops stare at him.

SHERIFF
Well, if it isn't the wildlife
experts. Did you come to it or go to
it?

WILLENHOLLY
Do you have a microwave here, Sheriff?

SHERIFF
We have a toaster oven. Why?

WILLENHOLLY
Because I need to dry my gun out so
I can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE!

SHERIFF
This might cheer you up.
(hands him paper)
Your office just faxed this over.
Guy there say it's a post from an
Internet chat board, signed by a
""Jay and Silent Bob."" Your man thinks
it's a lead as to where those fellas
are taking the ape.

WILLENHOLLY
(reading)
""All you motherfuckers are gonna
pay. You are the ones who are ball-
lickers.  We're gonna fuck your
mothers while you watch and cry like
little bitches. Once we get to
Hollywood--""
(looks up)
They're going to Hollywood.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD--MONTAGE

We take a quick visual tour of the city, including the sign,
the line of front of Krispy Kreme, the line in front of Coffee
Bean and Tea Leaf, the Simpson star in the Walk- of- Fame,
the Rocky and Bullwinkle statue, the Beverly Center, Jerry's
Famous Deli, the Hollywood and Vine sign, Mann's Chinese
Theatre, the Star Wars footprints outside of Mann's, the
Chateau Marmont, people on cell phones, Trashy Lingerie.
HOOKERS propositioning a potential JOHN, and finally--

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD--DAY

We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER
that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with
Silent Bob sitting in the back seat.  After a beat, Jay pops
up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around.
The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out
and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay
a look.

JAY
What? It's not like it's cheating.
Justice blew up.

Two HOOKERS approach them.

HOOKER 1
Hey, little man. You want some of
this?

HOOKER 2
How about you, Big Boy?

HOOKER 1
If you've got fifty bucks we can get
nasty.

JAY
Oh yeah? How nasty?

HOOKER 2
As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.

JAY
Alright--first, I'll want to tongue
your bung while you juggle my balls
in one hand and play with my asshole
with the other. But don't stick you
finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky
you and put it in your friend's brown,
while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie
cup. After that, I'll wanna smell
your titties, for a while, and you
can pull my nutsack up over my dick,
so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I
want you to flick at my nuts while
your friend spanks me into the same
Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then
we throw the Dixie cup out.

The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then--

HOOKER 1
Oh, that's it honey. I quit.
(walking away)
This job just passed the point of no
return.

HOOKER 2
(to Jay)
You one fucked up puppy, poppie.

JAY
(watching them go)
What?! You said 'nasty'?
(shakes his head; to
Bob)
Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck
up.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.--LATER

Jay and Silent Bob walk.

JAY
Alright, here's the plan: first, we
find out where they're shooting that
movie at. After we shut that shit
down, we can start looking for the
monkey. But before we do any of that
shit, we gotta find a motherfucker
in the know. Someone who's like, the
mayor of Hollywood.

They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a
sale.

DEALER
(subtly)
Crack? You want some crack? Sweet-
ass rock. Get you high.

JAY
No man, but you want some weed?

DEALER
(beat)
You on the job?

JAY
(pulling out a card)
Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.

CLOSE ON THE CARD.  It reads: UNITED JERSEY BROTHERHOOD OF
DEALERS, LOCAL 408.

There's a graphic of a stoner beside it.

DEALER
I'm Los Angeles Local 305!

They shake hands, slapping each other on the back like Union
brothers.

DEALER
You guys got medical in Jersey yet?

JAY
Shit, no, we might have to strike in
September.

DEALER
Norma Rae like a motherfucker. You
gots to get your benefits, you know
what I'm saying?

JAY
I hear that. Yo--maybe you can help
us out. You know where they're
shooting a movie around here.

DEALER
You in this town and you gonna ask
that question? Be a little more
specific.

JAY
It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust
it up so people stop calling us names
on the Internet, even though they're
not really talking about us but these
characters based on us, and at the
same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who-
got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's
monkey.

Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.

DEALER
I don't know that the fuck you just
said, little kid. But you touched a
brother's heart, so I'm gonna help
you out with some directions to the
studio.

JAY
You know where Miramax is at?

DEALER
Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for
seventy-eight percent of my business.

INT. E! ENTERTAINMENT NEWS--DAY

After E! news logo plays. CUT TO STEVE KMETKO in studio.

STEVE KMETKO
Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent
Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife
Marshal's Office tells us a posting
was pulled off an Internet movie
chat board that was allegedly written
by the two domestic terrorists
themselves. It's sending a shockwave
through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on
the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules?

Jules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate.

JULES ASNER
Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is
one of terror today, after the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office learned
that hot, new terrorists Jay and
Silent Bob are targeting Miramax
Studios for their next campaign of
blood, violence and monkey-theft. In
the posting, pulled off Movie Poop
Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome
threatened, quote--
(reading)
""Once we get to Hollywood and find
those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who
are making the Bluntman and Chronic
movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our
Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive-
Deleted, which is made up of our
Expletive-Deleted, then eat their
Expletive-Deleted, which is made up
of our Expletive-Deleted that we
made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we
haven't been able to get a statement
from anyone here are the studio.

BACK TO STEVE in the E! Studio.

STEVE
Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon are on the lot,
shooting a super-secret project.
Have you seen then roaming around?

BACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios.

JULES
No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck
buying a soda at a concession stand
earlier.

STEVE
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

JULES
None whatsoever. However, to be fair,
all the feds have to work with is
murky videotape, so no one's even a
hundred percent sure what Jay and
Silent Bob look like, exactly. For
all we know, they could already be
on the lot.

As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her,
looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera
and start waving behind Jules.

INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY

Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops
out of her seat.

JUSTICE
Oh my God! Jay! No!

Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on--

The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table.

Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks
for a beat, then--

JUSTICE
Fuck it.

She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in
her pocket.

INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY

The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls
to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the
bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning.
Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity.
Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As
she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads:
SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM.

EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY

The convertible skids out, taking off.

INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY

There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush
down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap).
Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note.

SISSY
That bitch!  That fucking, fucking
bitch!!!
(to girls)
Get dressed. We're going after her.

CHRISSY
Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet.

SISSY
Which is more important to you: a
fortune in diamonds or busting a
nut?

Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there
still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties.

SISSY (O.S.)
Chrissy! Now!

CHRISSY
Fuck--

Chrissy races back up the stairs.

EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY

The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main
gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's
just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then
lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.

JAY
We gotta play this right.

Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard
booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle
and giving chase.

EXT. STUDIO LOT--DAY

Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like
an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open
alley is a background painting that's being moved by some
SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.

JAY
I hate how fake Hollywood is.

The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by
their shoulders, spinning them around.

SECURITY GUARD
Where do you think you're going?

JAY
GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!

SECURITY GUARD
This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our
suspects in custody. We just beat
them.
(into walkie-talkie)
Echo Base, I've got a ten-o-seven
here: two unauthorizeds on the lot.
Request back-up.

VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.

SECURITY GUARD
No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code
for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben
Affleck's trailer.

VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.

JAY
Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll
suck your dick off if you let us go!

SECURITY GUARD
Contrary to what you believe, not
everyone in the movie business is
gay.

JAY
Well, how about this deal: he sucks
my dick while you watch and jerk
off.

The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them,
reaching into his pants.

SECURITY GUARD
Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.

Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.

JAY
Dude, it's either this or jail. And
you know what they make you do in
jail.

Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees,
reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low
to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists
into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.  Silent
Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved.
Jay looks at him.

JAY
Well what are you waiting for, bitch?
Start sucking. Bunnggg!
(looking around)
Alright--where they shooting this
movie at?

Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in
front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door.

JAY
Worth a shot. Like a shot in the
mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you
were really gonna suck my dick.

Silent Bob shakes his head ""no,"" wide-eyed as Jay heads off.
When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, ""Yeah--I
guess I was.""

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the
crowd.

A.D.
Alright--bar extras. Follow me.

The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in
and follow inside.

EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

An official-looking car tears down the road.

INT. CAR--SAME

Willenholly drives, dialing his cell phone.

PHONE VOICE
Federal Bureau of Investigation

WILLENHOLLY
Yes, this is Federal Wildlife Marshal
Willenholly. Can I speak with Agent
Sid Enmarty, please?

PHONE VOICE
One moment, please.

INT. AGENT ENMARTY'S OFFICE--SAME

AGENT SID ENMARTY works at his desk.

SPEAKER VOICE
Agent Enmarty? A Marshal Willenholly
calling.

AGENT SID
(perking up)
Holy shit! Yeah, put him through.
(calling off)
YO! INCOMING BITCH BOY PHONER!

Two other AGENTS rush in, chuckling. All gather around the
phone as Sid presses the speaker button.

AGENT SID
Willenholly?

BEGIN CROSS-CUTTING WITH WILLENHOLLY.

WILLENHOLLY
Sid? Hey, buddy. I'm calling because
I could really use your help on this
killer case I'm working.

AGENT SID
I'll bet, Will. What's it this time...
Beaver trouble? Some kind of
unauthorized marsupial trafficking?

The agents crack up, stifling their laughter.

WILLENHOLLY
(taking it in stride)
No, no--nothing like that. Say--there
aren't other people listening in,
are there?

AGENT SID
No way, man. It's just me and you
talking here.

WILLENHOLLY
Good. I'm tracking a monkey down
that's on it's way to Los Angeles,
and I could use some bureau backup.

AGENT SID
Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should
stake out Clint Eastwood's place.
Didn't he used to drive around with
a monkey that'd punch people and
drink beer?

The Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on.

WILLENHOLLY
Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone?

AGENT SID
No way--Dunston!

WILLENHOLLY
Alright, now that's not fair. I know
I didn't make it as high up as you
guys, but my job's just as important.

AGENT SID
Calm down, Will. Don't go all...
bananas on us!

The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed.

WILLENHOLLY
I come to you as a friend--as a fellow
professional--and this is the shit I
get?!

AGENT SID
You're right, Will. Tell you what--
we'll get our best man on your case
right away. You might've heard of
him. He's a doctor.

WILLENHOLLY
(excited)
Oh, a doctor?

AGENT SID
His name's Doctor Zaius!

The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly
tears up, enraged.

WILLENHOLLY
SCREW YOU GUYS!

Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking
laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries.

EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS LOT--DAY

The Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

Jay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob
looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay
looks and sees--

A COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good
Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk).
MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene.
BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR.

BEN
Where are we taking it from, Gus?

Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money.
He just shrugs.

GUS
I'm busy.

BEN
You're a true artist, Gus

MATT
Just take it from ""It's a good
course.""

BEN
Oh, now you're the director.

MATT
Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's
remember who talked who into doing
this shit in the first place. Talking
me into Dogma was one thing, but
this--

BEN
I'm sorry this is taking you away
from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-
who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-
flick you're supposed to be doing
this week.

MATT
Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you
never saw Forces of Nature?

BEN
You're like a child. What've I been
telling you? Sometimes you've gotta
do the safe picture. Sometimes, you
do it for art. Sometimes, it's the
payback picture your friend says you
owe him--

They take a beat and look at the camera. Then--

BEN
And sometimes, you go back to the
well.

MATT
And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.

BEN
Now that's just mean.

Jay turns excitedly to Bob.

JAY
This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick,
'cause that's those two fucks from
that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do
is figure out a way to get close to
them--

The A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto
the set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.

A.D.
Just stand there and react. Don't
say anything.

Bob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.

JAY
(off A.D.'s comment)
That's pretty funny.

A.D.
(calling out)
Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's
go for picture.

Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are
oblivious.

JAY
On the count of three, we rush those
fucks and beat the shit out of 'em.
'Cause if they're all fucked up,
they can't make the move, right?
Alright, then.  One--two--

CLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)
Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.

Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C.

The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face.
It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.

CLAPPER/LOADER
Scene sixteen, take five.

The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben
looks to Gus.

BEN
Action, Gus?

Gus looks up from counting his money.

GUS
Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.

Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.

BEN/CHUCKIE
You should check it out, it's a good
course. But, you know, frankly, I
found the class rather elementary.

CLARK
You know, I don't doubt that it was.
I remember that class. It was just
between recess and lunch.

BEN/CHUCKIE
Are we gonna have a problem, again?

CLARK
There's no problem. I was still just
hoping you might give me some insight
into the evolution of the market
economy in the Southern Colonies.
See, Wood says--

MATT/WILL
(stepping in)
What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be
back here regurgitating Gordon Wood.
But you forgot about Vickers--

CLARK
No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up
on inherited wealth, Hunting. But
you're not the angry, brilliant young
mind you once were, just itching to
vent your frustrations.

In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out
of the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the
A.D.

CLARK
Once Sean told you it wasn't your
fault, you lost the edge, William.
You stopped hitting the books with a
vengeance, and now I've read shit
you haven't even heard about yet.
Face facts, my friend--love made you
a soft little pussy boy, unable to
stand up to an academic showdown,
like you used to. You're just no
longer that good--Will Hunting.
(gets in his face)
Now how do you like them apples?

Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking
downwards, steaming.

BEN/CHUCKIE
I don't like the sound of them apples.
Will, what're we gonna do now?

MATT/WILL
Chuckie--
(snarling)
It's Hunting season.

Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands.
He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will
stands there, guns smoking.

BEN/CHUCKIE
Apple sauce, bitch.

Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the
Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other
SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a
ten-oh-seven on our hands.

BEN
Wait a second! I wasn't with any
hookers today!

The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He
points, screaming.

SECURITY GUARD
THERE THEY ARE!

Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.

JAY
Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms,
yo.

Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the
Security guards.  Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.

MATT
If anyone's looking for me, I'll be
in my trailer trying to figure out
how I got here from an Academy Award.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door,
blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across
from them and head inside a door.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see--

Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar-
looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The
Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4

CLAPPER/LOADER
Scream four, scene thirty-seven,
take one.
(claps it and rushes
off)

WES CRAVEN
Action!

The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff,
until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.

SHANNEN DOHERTY
Alright, you bastard! Let's see who
you really are!

Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal
SUZANNE.

Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.

SHANNEN DOHERTY
Fucking Miramax--
(getting up)
CUT!

Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.

WES CRAVEN
Shannen, usually I say ""cut.""

SHANNEN DOHERTY
A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't
even trying anymore, are you?

WES CRAVEN
The market research suggest that
people love monkeys.

Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.

JAY
WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!

They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.

WES CRAVEN
See?

Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.

EXT. LOT--DAY

Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne.
On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting.
The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--

At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four
Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking
their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the
other Security Guards gaining.

JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?

Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the
bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.

Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and
jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling
away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse.
Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.

JAY
PUNCH IT!!!

Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the
vehicle, taking flight,

Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--

Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front
basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a
soundstage) a la E.T.

Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then
they look ahead and let out a scream.

The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage
Building.

INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling
onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.

JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent
Bob, looking down as them.

JAMES
Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.

JASON
Are you guys alright?
(off Suzanne)
Hey! They've got a monkey!

Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.

JAY
Yo, I think that shit just kicked
in.

JAMES
Let's get you guys on your feet.

James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All
stare at one another, perplexed,

Then--

JAY
(to James)
See man?  Its never, ""Hey--you were
in Loser, or, ""Dude--you rocked in
Boys and Girls."" It always comes
back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted
by it.!

JAMES
Well, you put your dick in a pie,
dude--

JASON
Enough!
(to Jay)
Jason Biggs.

JAY
Yo-you really get to third base with
the Russsian chick like you did in
the movies?

JASON
You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.

JAY
She's fucking hot, man. If I was
you, I'd been like--

Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look
on, bewildered.

JAY
(off James's-look)
What, man? You never did one of these?

Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James,
blown away.

JAY
Holy shit? You're the Dawson!

JAMES
It's James, actually. James Van Der
Beek.

JAY
Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing
Joey away from you? If I was you, I
would've drowned his ass in your
Creek and shit!

JAMES
I know, Because what--is Josh better
looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean,
who on earth is better looking that
me? I ask you.

JAY
Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did
you ever get to third base with her?

JAMES
Well, there was this one time--
(catching himself)
Wait a second--who are you guys?!

JASON
They're our stunt doubles, dumbass.
(to Jay)
Right?

JAY
Stunt doubles for what?

JAMES
The movie we start shooting in a few
minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike
Back.

JASON
(to Bob)
You're doubling me. I'm playing
Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.

JAMES
Bob

JASON
Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA
Ray.

JAMES
Jay! Shit, did you even read the
script?

JASON
There's a script?

Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his
finger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a
huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.

JAY
These are the guys who are playing
us, yo. We take them out, and bickety-
bam! No movie.

Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off,
leaving Jay and Bob to huddle.

JASON
(off Jay and Bob, to
James)
What's with the weird, gay huddle
going on over there?

JAMES
What's gay about it? It's two guys
talking in a corner. Man--why are
you such a homophobe.

JASON
I'm not a homophobe.

JAMES
You are. You're always calling things
gay. ""Ooo--look at the gay huddle,
dude!""

Suzanne approaches them.

JASON
Hey--look at the monkey.

JAMES
Next you're going to tell me the
monkey's gay.

JASON
He's so cute--
(to Suzanne)
C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--

Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.

While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a
beating are heard, O.C.

JAY
Alright, here's what we do: start
swinging, and don't stop until those
young Hollywood fucks are out of
commission. Ready? Break!

Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-
eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied
and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward,
clasped like a champion.

JAY
That's one funky monkey.

Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.

VOICE (O.S.)
Mister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--
Beek? This is Security. We've got a
pair of intruders at large, and they
crashed through a window we thought
might be yours.

JAY
(to door; deepening
voice)
Uh--yeah. They're in here.

SECURITY GUARD
Do they have you hostage? Should we
call your publicists?

JAY
NO! I mean, we kicked those guys'
asses bad. They're--knocked out.

EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME

The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.

SECURITY GUARD
Great work, sirs! If you let us in,
we'll take over--

JAY (O.S.)
(through door)
NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in
here! Together!

The Security guard look at one another.

SECURITY GUARD
Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the
door, sirs.

The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job
face to the rest.

INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it
and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods,
and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the
vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.

JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?! How
are we gonna get out of here without
them seeing us?

Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet,
smiling.

EXT. LOT--DAY

The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a
waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and
Silent Bob.

JAMES
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!

JASON
HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M
THE PIE-FUCKER.

SECURITY GUARD
(to Cops)
He'll be the pie--in prison.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY

Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).

JAY
This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In
these outfits we're totally incognito.

Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.

A.D.
Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?
Great--you've changed costumes
already. Let's get you to set.
(pulling them off)
The director doesn't like to be kept
waiting.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET

It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side,
near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs
the hustling, white crew.

DIRECTOR
Look at all these crackers, Seventy
million dollars and I can't even get
a black grip?

A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.

P.A.
Here's your coffee, sir.

DIRECTOR
(eyes the coffee)
You spit in this?  Because I know
all you white folks are pissed off
that the studio'd entrust a multi-
million dollar to a brother.

P.A.
I didn't spit in it, sir.

DIRECTOR
Then taste it! Go on!

The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it
back to the Director.

P.A.
It's all good, sir.

DIRECTOR
No it ain't all good. Oh, you think
I want it now, after your lips touched
the cup? Get the fuck off my set!

P.A.
You the man, sir.

DIRECTOR
No you the Man! And that's the
problem!

The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously
skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.

BANKY
Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky
Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and
Chronic. We met a few weeks back.
I'm the executive producer.

DIRECTOR/CHAKA
Oh--you're the executive producer,
hunh? Well go ""produce"" me a latte
no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?

BANKY
Banky. I just wanted you to know
that I respect your work as an artist.
I'm something of an artist myself. I
was the inker on the comic book.

CHAKA
An inker? What, like you trace?

Banky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.

A.D.
Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the
set, Chaka.

CHAKA
I don't see 'em. Where are they?
(into bullhorn)
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS
PIECE OF SHIT?!

On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake
rock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob
survey the set, amazed.

JAY
This must've set 'em back a couple
hundred bucks.

CHAKA
Look at this shit.
(off their outfits)
A gay hood ornament, and the color
Purple.

JAY
Who the fuck are you?

CHAKA
Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking
director, is who I am. Chaka Luther
King. The creator of all of this.

JAY
Wait a sec--I thought Holden and
Banky created this shit.

CHAKA
And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it
back for all the shit you people
have stolen from us! Did you know, I
came up with the idea for Sesame
Street before PBS? I was going to
call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.
(beat)
Alright--enough small talk. Let's
shoot it.

Chaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.

JAY
Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna
direct us?

CHAKA
I'll be directing you to the food
stamps line after I fire your ass,
if you talk back like that to me
again!

JAY
But we don't know what we're supposed
to do here. We didn't even read the
script.

CHAKA
So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did
the studio.
(pointing O.C.)
Look man, it's not hard. In this
scene, the bad guy breaks into the
Bluntcave.  You make up some shit,
fight him for a while, I film it, I
yell ""cut,"" and then head back to my
trailer, where I got more white women
waiting for me there than the first
lifeboat off the Titanic!
(confidentially)
They all want a part of the movie,
and I got just the part for 'em.

Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.

CHAKA
LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!

A.D. (O.S.)
QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!

Chaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him
with another cup of coffee.

P.A.
I got you another cup of coffee,
sir. Spit free.

Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.

The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and
Bob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.

CLAPPER/LOADER
I just wanna say that I loved when
you fucked that pie.
(calling off)
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,
SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!

The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From
behind the monitor,

Chaka calls out--

CHAKA
ACTION!

Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for
a beat. Then--

JAY/CHRONIC
Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.

Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit
the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the
arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking
man with huge, overgrown FISTS.

JAY/CHRONIC
What the fuck?

COCK-KNOCKER
You thought I'd never find your
precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp
Knight? But now you and your sidekick
are finally in the grasp of Cock-
Knocker!

JAY/CHRONIC
Why do they call you ""Cock-Knocker""?

Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls.
Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a
vibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button
on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a
light saber.

COCK-KNOCKER
Any last words before I bust your
balls, Bluntman?

Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--

A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the
placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.
It's out of his reach.

Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his
hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.

Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.
The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive
pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair
start light saber dueling.

CHAKA
(from behind monitor)
Damn! Now that was one special effect!
This picture's gonna make House Party
look like House Party Two!

A.D.
Or House Party Three?

CHAKA
Shut the fuck up!

Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive
blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the
ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He
lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-
Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on
his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver
a saber kill-shot, when we hear--

JAY (O.S.)
YO-BITCH-FISTS!

Cock-Knocker turns to see--

Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a
double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la
the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).

JAY
Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.

Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong
Saber.

CHAKA
(from behind the
monitor)
I think George Lucas is going to sue
somebody--

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a
shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside
the flashing red light.

WILLENHOLLY
(looking around)
So, this is Hollywood?
(suddenly full of
purpose)
Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent
Bob.

Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two
shots, O.C.

WILLENHOLLY
FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!

Willenholly goes wide-eyed.

It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a
kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a
Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare
back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking
bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.

WILLENHOLLY
Oh my God--
(to kids)
Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a
warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm
on the wrong, uh--wrong set.

The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the
O.C. Willenholly.

KID
You killed Mooby--
(to Kids)
LET'S GET HIM!!!

The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as
he's attacked.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.

COCK-KNOCKER
(breaking character)
You are not upstaging me, Van Der
Beek!

Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker,
hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear
reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade
the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other
hand.

COCK-KNOCKER
(to O.C. Chaka)
CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A
""CUT""!

On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's
huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).

Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber,
Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.

JAY
Now whose balls have been busted,
bitch?

Suddenly, a gun shot rings out.

All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun
first on Jay, then Bob.

WILLENHOLLY
The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and
Silent Bob!
(revealing badge:
calling out)
Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal
Wildlife Marshal. These men are the
leaders of a terrorist organization
wanted for the abduction of a monkey.

VOICE (O.S.)
They didn't really steal that monkey.

All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows.
Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.

JUSTICE
It was just a diversion so we could
steal these.

Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing
them.

JUSTICE
And they're not the leaders of
C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.

WILLENHOLLY
No--the clit's real. The female orgasm
is a myth.

JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Are you guys alright?

JAY
I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty
Fuck.

JUSTICE
(smiling)
You remembered.
(back to business)
It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,
Chrissy, and I are international
jewel thieves. We were setting you
up as a patsy, but I couldn't go
through with it, because I... because
I love you.

JAY
Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me,
right?

VOICE (O.S.)
If she does, it'll be considered
necrophilia.

All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the
shadows, guns drawn.

SISSY
Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.
(to Justice)
Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad
time?

MISSY
You should've just let these guys go
down, Jussy.

JAY
Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was
waiting until I got to know her a
little better. See, there was this
little angel on my shoulder, and he
said--

CHRISSY
Shut the fuck up before I shoot you
where you stand in your pansy red
booties.

JAY
(looking down)
Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red
booties!
(to Bob)
Man--why the fuck didn't you tell
me?

SISSY
Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.

JUSTICE
I can't do that, Sissy

SISSY
(points her gun at
Jay)
Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.

CHAKA
YO!

All turn to look at Chaka.

CHAKA
Would any of you lovely ladies like
a private audition to be in my movie?

Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on
the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and
running for cover.

Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.

Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed
craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start
firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren
craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented
can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are
out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and
reload. From behind his table,

Willenholly yells--

WILLENHOLLY
WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M
JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!

CHRISSY
TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,
TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!

MISSY
AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.

WILLENHOLLY
ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!

The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire
again.

Chaka ducks behind the monitor.

CHAKA
A shitload of white people with guns?
Time to get my black ass out of here!

He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each
other defensively, striking kung fu poses.

SISSY
You really let me down, Justice.
Throwing it all away for a little
stoner with bad pronunciation.

JAY (O.S.)
HEY!

JUSTICE
(ignoring him)
What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which
fighting style do you want me to
kick your ass in?

SISSY
Are you kidding me? I taught you all
all your moves myself. There's not a
style you can bust that I can't defend
against.

JUSTICE
You're no match for my ""Shaolin Monk.""

SISSY
Yeah, but I can bury you with my
""Crouching Tiger.""

JUSTICE
A little ""Venus's--flytrap""?

SISSY
I'll counter with ""Dragon Crane.""

JUSTICE
How about a little ""Bitch, My Man
Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy""?

SISSY
(beat; smiles)
Bring it on.

Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch
into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and
screaming.

Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.

JAY
Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other
one's shirt off and we see some tit.

Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins
them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.

BANKY
Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I
just wanted to say hi. I'm--

JAY
Banky fucking Edwards! Just the
motherfucker we came to see!

BANKY
(shocked)
Holy shit! What the fuck are you
guys doing here?!

Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the
floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

BANKY
Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!

JAY
All these assholes are calling us
names on the Internet, 'cause of
this stupid movie!

BANKY
I feel for you boys--I really do.
Those Net snipers can be really cruel.
But Miramax paid me a shitload of
money for Bluntman and Chronic, so
it occurs to me that people bad-
mouthing you on some web-site is
none of my FUCKING CONCERN!

SILENT BOB
Oh--but I think it is.

Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.

JAY
Here we go again--

SILENT BOB
Shut the fuck up.
(to Banky)
We had a deal with you on the comics
for likeness rights. And as we're
not only the artistic basis but also
the character basis for your
intellectual property, Bluntman and
Chronic, when we said property was
optioned by Miramax Films you were
legally obliged to secure our
permission to transfer the concept
to another medium. As you failed to
do that, you're in breach of the
original contract--ergo, you find
yourself in a very actionable
position.

Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a
beat, Jay adds--

JAY
Yeah.

Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head
and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.

BANKY
So, what do you guys want, to go
away and take your lady friends with
you?

JAY
Shitcan this movie so we don't get
called names on the Internet anymore.

BANKY
Even if there's no movie, people are
still free to talk shit about you on
the Internet. That's what the
Internet's for: slandering others
anonymously.  Stopping the flick
isn't going to stop that!

In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the
air.

JAY
Well this isn't fair!  We went to
Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole
a monkey, we got shot at, and got
punched in the motherfucking nuts!
We ain't leaving empty-handed!

On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.

JAY
What's up baby? You look good!

BANKY
Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?

JAY
Oh yeah.
(pushing Sissy off
him)
Get the fuck offa me, pig!

Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.

Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

BANKY
You guys are gonna ruin my movie
career.

JAY
Well, we want something for our mental
anguish.

BANKY
Tell you what: we'll settle this
monetarily. I'll give you half of
what I made.

JAY
Half?!?

BANKY
Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll
give you two-thirds of what I made!

JAY
Fuck-you--you already said half? You
can't take it back!

Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.

BANKY
Done

Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing
each other.

SISSY
Your shit is so tired, Justice!

JUSTICE
Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!

Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.

Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop
Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out.

Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.

WILLENHOLLY
Hello? Truce?
(beat)
I think I killed both of them.

Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing
a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind
him, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her
handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.

JUSTICE
C'mon guys. It's over.

Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.

JAY
Yo, I was just about to jump in there
and get your back.

Then, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.

JAY
Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get
out of here!

JUSTICE
No. I'm tired of running.

Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps
his face.

JUSTICE
You awake, Marshal? Marshal?

WILLENHOLLY
(tries to move but
can't)
Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey
shot me in the ass and paralyzed me!
Oh the irony!

JUSTICE
(off Suzanne's gun)
You're not paralyzed. It was just a
tranquilizer.

WILLENHOLLY
Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!
My friends in the Bureau are never
gonna let me live this down!

JUSTICE
You have friends in the F.B.I.?

WILLENHOLLY
(crying)
They all made it in, but I failed
the exam. Why the hell else do you
think I became a Federal Wildlife
Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!

Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking.
Then--

JUSTICE
Maybe not. I can make you a deal
that'll get you into the F.B.I.,
regardless of test scores.

WILLENHOLLY
What kind of deal?

JUSTICE
You drop the charges against Jay and
Silent Bob and say you never found
the ape.  Make sure the world knows
they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.

JAY
Now wait a second--

JUSTICE
I'll explain later, Jay
(to Willenholly)
In exchange, I'll give you the
diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,
Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I
want a reduced sentence.

WILLENHOLLY
You'd be willing to do that?

JUSTICE
(off Jay)
For him? I'd be willing to do
anything.

Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands.

JUSTICE
I'm an international jewel thief
who's facing a jail sentence.

JAY
That's alright. I'm a junkie with a
monkey.

JUSTICE
If I go to prison, will you wait for
me?

JAY
I don't know. Will we fuck when you
get out?

Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should
say it all, but--

JAY
Don't change the subject. Will we
fuck when you get out?

JUSTICE
Snoogans.

Justice and Jay kiss again.

Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs
his face and kisses him.

Willenholly looks to Banky.

WILLENHOLLY
Wow. There's a lot of love in the
room.

BANKY
Regardless of what you may have heard.
I do not kiss guys.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER

Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls
her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.

WILLENHOLLY
Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.
(to Jay: friendly)
Hey--stop stealing monkeys.

JAY
Fuck you.

WILLENHOLLY
Fair enough.

Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the
car.

JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Wait for me.

JAY
What--here?

Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,
leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking
down the lot.

BANKY
Well, boys--you're rich in love--
(indicating Jay)
Well, you're in love. And to top
that off, you've got your own monkey.
What more could two guys from Jersey
possibly want?

JAY
All those fucks to stop talking shit
about us on the Internet, for
starters.

BANKY
What do I keep telling you? There's
not much you can do to stop that.
Well, short of showing up at all
their houses and beating the shit
out of them, I guess.

Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and
smile.

JAY
(to Bob)
You know--with all that money we're
gonna make we can buy a lotta plane
tickets.

START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE

EXT. SKY--DAY

A passenger JET flies through the sky.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check
the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod
at each other, and cross the street.

INT. HOUSE--DAY

The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent
Bob standing in the doorway.

MOTHER
Can I help you?

JAY
Yes. Ma'am, Does--
(reading of paper)
William Dusky live here?

MOTHER
Yes. He's my son.

JAY
May we talk to him, please.

MOTHER
One moment.

She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes
to the door.

KID
Yeah?

JAY
Yo--do you post as--
(reading off paper)
Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?

KID
Yeah.

JAY
And did you write ""Fuck Jay and Silent
Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?

KID
Yeah, a while ago. So?

Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him
outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front
lawn.

EXT. SKY--DAY

The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite
direction.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY

Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.
They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the
door.

JAY
On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say
Jay and Silent Bob--
(reading off paper)
""--are fucking clown shoes. If they
were real, I'd beat the shit out of
them for being so stupid.""

KID
(chuckling)
Yeah.

JAY
Really--

Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit
out of him.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.

EXT. RECTORY--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.

INT. OFFICE--DAY

Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT

The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!

WORLD PREMIERE!

The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see
DANTE and RANDAL.

RANDAL
Now that was worse then Clash of the
Titans.

DANTE
I still can't believe Judy Dench
played me.

RANDAL
Hey--remind me to renew that
restraining order.

DANTE
Why?

RANDAL
Because I'm gonna blast the flick on
the Internet tonight.

STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.

STEVE-DAVE
Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent
comic book movie?

WALT
Tell'em Steve-Dave!

STEVE-DAVE
Would you stop saying that?

ALYSSA and TRISH come out.

TRISH
Well, that was just another paean to
male adolescence and its refusal to
grow up.

ALYSSA
Yeah, sis--but it was better than
Mallrats. At least Holden had the
good sense to keep his name off of
it.

TRISH
Why wouldn't Miramax option his other
comic instead? You know--the one he
drew about you and him and your
relationship?

ALYSSA
You mean Chasing Amy? That would
never work as a movie.

BANKY and HOOPER exit.

BANKY
I'm so fucking embarrassed--

HOOPER
Honey, you should be. They took your
characters and reduced them to one
ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was
like watching Batman and Robin again.

BANKY
Thanks. That means a lot coming from
the guy who pretends to be Shaft as
opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

HOOPER
I don't hear you complaining nightly.
In fact, the only thing I do hear
you say is ""Yes, Hooper! Cradle the
balls and work the shaft!""

BANKY
(looking around)
Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in
public!

A guy behind them calls out to Banks.

GUY
Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!

BANKY
(recognizing him)
You--!

GUY
That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm
back for round two!

Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him,
while Hooper tries to break them up.

WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a
prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.

WILLENHOLLY
You know, I don't get out to the
movies much. But I'd have to say
Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!

JUSTICE
Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

WILLENHOLLY
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.

JAY
YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,
FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE
WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!

WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing
""The Bird."" During the song, Morris points to--

Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's
still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob,
they nod at each other and--

Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage,
and dance us out to the coda, which reads--

CODA

Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3
million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial
failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly
drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat
boards, and over the course of the next year, while they
waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay
and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out
of them.

CREDITS. THEN--

INT. NOWHERE

A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW
ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips
off.

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground

A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]

Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_The%20Beatles_Maxwells%20Silver%20Hammer.ttl,The Beatles,Maxwell’s Silver Hammer,"[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)"

We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now, today, I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

[Verse 2]
Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before?)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before?)
When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

[Bridge]
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry

[Verse 3]
We said our goodbye (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now, today, I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry

I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl

Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, ""This time you'd better stop""

Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_Four%20Brothers_Woody%20Herman%20and%20His%20Orchestra.ttl,James Joyce,Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops),"I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.

—Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?

—Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?

—Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.

—What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.

—Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.

—Circumcised? says Joe.

—Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.

—That the lay you're on now? says Joe.

—Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?

For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.
—Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.

—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.
—What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.

—Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.

—Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.

—Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.

—Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.

—Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?

—Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.

—-What was that, Joe? says I.

—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.

So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.

In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.

And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.

I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.

So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.

—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.

The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.

—Stand and deliver, says he.

—That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.

—Pass, friends, says he.

Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:

—What's your opinion of the times?

Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.

—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.

So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:

—Foreign wars is the cause of it.
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:

—It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.

—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.

—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.

—Wine of the country, says he.

—What's yours? says Joe.

—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.

—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.

—Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.

The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.

He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.

So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.

—And there's more where that came from, says he.

—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.

—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.

—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.

Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.

—For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.

And he starts reading them out:

—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...

—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.

—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?

—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.

—I will, says he, honourable person.

—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.

Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.

And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.

Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.

—Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...

And he doubled up.

—Take a what? says I.

—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.

—O hell! says I.

The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.

—Bi i dho husht, says he.

—Who? says Joe.

—Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.

—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.

—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?

—Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...

And he started laughing.

—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?

—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.

Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.

Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.

But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.

—What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?

—What's that? says Joe.

—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.

So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.

—Are you codding? says I.

—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.

So Joe took up the letters.

—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.

So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:

—How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?

—I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...

—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?

—With Dignam, says Alf.

—Is it Paddy? says Joe.

—Yes, says Alf. Why?

—Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.

—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.

—Ay, says Joe.

—Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.

—Who's dead? says Bob Doran.

—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.

—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?

—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?

—Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.

—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.

—Paddy? says Alf.

—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.

—Good Christ! says Alf.

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.

In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.

He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.

—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.

—Who? says I.

—Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.

And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.

Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.

—Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.

And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:

—Who said Christ is good?

—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.

—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?

—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.

But Bob Doran shouts out of him.

—He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.

Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.

—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.

The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.

—The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.

And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.

Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.

—Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.

So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.

—O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?

And he starts reading out one.

7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.

Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...

—Show us, Joe, says I.

—... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...

—Jesus, says I.

—... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...

The citizen made a grab at the letter.

—Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.
H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.

—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.

—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?

So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.

—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.

And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.

—They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.

And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.

In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.

So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.

—There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.

—What's that? says Joe.

—The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.

—That so? says Joe.

—God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in

Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.

—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.

—That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...

And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.

So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:

—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!

Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.

And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!

—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.

—Ay, ay, says Joe.

—You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...

—Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.

The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.

Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:

—God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.

So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.

So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.

—Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.

—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.

So he calls the old dog over.

—What's on you, Garry? says he.

Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.

All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.

The curse of my curses
Seven days every day
And seven dry Thursdays
On you, Barney Kiernan,
Has no sup of water
To cool my courage,
And my guts red roaring
After Lowry's lights.

So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.

—I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.

Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:

—Could you make a hole in another pint?

—Could a swim duck? says I.

—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.

—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.

—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?

—Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.

—Whose admirers? says Joe.

—The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.

Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.

So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.

—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.

—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.

—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.

And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.

So Terry brought the three pints.

—Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.

—Slan leat, says he.

—Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.

Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.

—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.

—Friend of yours, says Alf.

—Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?

—I won't mention any names, says Alf.

—I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.

—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.

So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.

Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.

—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.

—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.

—Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.

—That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?

—Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.

Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?

Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.

Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.

Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)

Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.

Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.

(Ironical opposition cheers.)

The speaker: Order! Order!

(The house rises. Cheers.)

—There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?

—Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.

—Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.

—Is that really a fact? says Alf.

—Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?

So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.

Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?

—No, says Joe.

—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.

—Who? Blazes? says Joe.

And says Bloom:

—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.

—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.

—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.

—-True for you, says Joe.

And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:

—Now, don't you think, Bergan?

—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.

It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.

—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.

—He is, says Joe. Isn't he?

—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.

—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.

—My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.

He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.

Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.

Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.

And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.

—Hello, Ned.

—Hello, Alf.

—Hello, Jack.

—Hello, Joe.

—God save you, says the citizen.

—Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?

—Half one, says Ned.

So J. J. ordered the drinks.

—Were you round at the court? says Joe.

—Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.

—Hope so, says Ned.

Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.

—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.

—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.

—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.

—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.

—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.

—Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.

—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.

—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.

—Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.

—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.

—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.

—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.

—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.

—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...

—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.

—Nor good red herring, says Joe.

—That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.

Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.

—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.

Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.

—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.

—Good health, Ned, says J. J.

—-There he is again, says Joe.

—Where? says Alf.

And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.

—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.

—Remanded, says J. J.

One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.

—Who tried the case? says Joe.

—Recorder, says Ned.

—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.

—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.

—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.

And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:

—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?

—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.

—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.

And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.

—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.

So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.

—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.

—Rely on me, says Joe.

—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.

—O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.

—Consider that done, says Joe.

—Very kind of you, says Bloom.

—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.

—Decree nisi, says J. J.

And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.

—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.

—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.

—Give us a squint at her, says I.

And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.

—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!

—There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.

—Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?

O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.

—It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.

So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.

—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.

—The European family, says J. J....

—They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.

And says John Wyse:

—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.

And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:

—Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.

—What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.

—Gold cup, says he.

—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.

—Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.

—And Bass's mare? says Terry.

—Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.

—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.

—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.

So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.

—Not there, my child, says he.

—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.

And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.

—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.

—Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?

—As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...

—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.

—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.

The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.

—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.

—And will again, says Joe.

—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.

And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.

—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?

—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.

—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?

—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.

Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.

—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?

—I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.

So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.

—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.

And says John Wyse:

—'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.

Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.

—That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.

The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.

—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.

—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.

They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.

—But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?

Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.

—We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.

—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...

—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.

—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?

—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.

—Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.

—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?

Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.

—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.

—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!

—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.

—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.

And says J. J.:

—Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.

—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.

—Yes, sir, says he. I will.

—You? says Joe.

—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.

—Repeat that dose, says Joe.

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.

—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.

—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.

—Yes, says Bloom.

—What is it? says John Wyse.

—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.

—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.

So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:

—Or also living in different places.

—That covers my case, says Joe.

—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.

—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.

The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.

—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.

—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.

The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.

—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?

—That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.

—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.

Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.

—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.

—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.

—I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.

—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.

That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.

—But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.

—What? says Alf.

—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.

Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.

—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.

—Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.

—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.

Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.

—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.

—Hurrah, there, says Joe.

—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.

And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.

—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?

—What's that? says Joe.

So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:

—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.

—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.

—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.

—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.

—No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.

—And a very good initial too, says Joe.

—That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.

—Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?

—Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.

—Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.

—I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.

—Who? says I.

—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.

—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?

—That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.

—He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.

—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.

—There you are, says Terry.

Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.

—Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.

Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.

Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.

—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!

So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.

Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.

—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.

—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.

—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.

—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?

An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.

—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.

—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?

Mine host bowed again as he made answer:

—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?

—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!

—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.

So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.

—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.

—Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?

—That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.

—Who made those allegations? says Alf.

—I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.

—And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?

—Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.

—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.

—Who is Junius? says J. J.

—We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.

—He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.

—Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.

—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.

—That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!

—Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.

—Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.

—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.

—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.

—En ventre sa mère, says J. J.

—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.

—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.

—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.

—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.

Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.

—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.

—A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.

—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.

—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.

—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.

—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.

—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.

—Amen, says the citizen.

—And I'm sure He will, says Joe.

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.

—Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.

—Qui fecit coelum et terram.

—Dominus vobiscum.

—Et cum spiritu tuo.

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:

—Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.

—And so say all of us, says Jack.

—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.

—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.

I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.

—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...

—No, says Martin, we're ready.

Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.

—Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,

—Beg your pardon, says he.

—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.

—Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.

And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.

—Bye bye all, says Martin.

And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.

—-Off with you, says

Martin to the jarvey.

The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.

But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.

—Let me alone, says he.

And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:

—Three cheers for Israel!

Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.

And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:

—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!

And says he:

—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.

—He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.

—Whose God? says the citizen.

—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.

Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.

—By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.

By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.

—Stop! Stop! says Joe.

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontlátásra, kedves baráton! Visszontlátásra! Gone but not forgotten.

Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:

—Where is he till I murder him?

And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.

—Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.

But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.

—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!

Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.

The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of débris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.

—Did I kill him, says he, or what?

And he shouting to the bloody dog:

—After him, Garry! After him, boy!

And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.

When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_Dinah_Fats%20Waller%20and%20His%20Rhythm.ttl,The Last Poets,Bird’s Word,"Everything was silent
And then Ma Rainey spread Black News
By way of the Backwater Blues
As Bessie Smith picked up on it
And spread the word, thru music and song
Then the message passed on
To Chick Webb, King Oliver, Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton
And they played the word and passed it along to Louis Armstrong
Fats Navarro, Charlie Ventura, Roy Eldridge and Fats Waller
Who was known to holler
The joint is jumpin with a Fatman's joy
As everybody started Stompin' at the Savoy
Then the word grew strong, as the immortal Bird came along
And blew all the Blackness that was true
With some Be-Bop brand new
Turning everybody on, with his unforgettable horn
As Lester Young became the first Prez of our race
And we turned around and dug on the beautiful face of Billie Holiday
As Billie began to sing praises to the blackman's thing
The good Brother Monk threw in some funk
So that the whole world could see
What he is, was and always will be
A genius creatively!
Then Miles began to set new styles
That put us miles ahead
As Dizzy set us free to be ourselves
And ride to heaven from hell in the latest
El-Do-Ra-Do, comin' far to carry us home!
Then Dinah sang finer
As Duke and Ella rode to fame
Goin' to Harlem on the A train
And we tuned into Charlie Mingus's bass
Setting a soulful pace
That let us taste the down sound
That found our hearts beating to the voice and drums
Of Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach
In their hip approach to Blackness!
Then Eddie Jefferson crooned an original tune
As Lambert, Hendricks and Ross scatted a new course
And we sampled King Pleasure's treasure
And listened to James Moody's moans
And then dug the dynamite drums of Brother Philly Joe Jones!
As Milt Jackson played the vibes in leaps and strides
With the MJQ (MJQ = Modern Jazz Quartet)
That sped our prides into sophisticate funkiness
Meanwhile, Sonny Rollins was building a bridge
For us to leave behind our grief
For the soulful relief
To find our own black minds
To tune in on Bud Powell
Who played the piano with funky hands
As he filled the seats and made 'em stand
On funky nights down Birdland (jazz club in NYC)
Then the Mighty Hawk made his horn talk (Coleman Hawkins)
And we heard Baby Ray play What'd I say
And jammed the set to dig Ornette
As Art Blakey broke free
Spreadin' the message to you and me
To dig on the trumpet of KD (KD = Kenny Dorham)
As we broadened our range
And counted our change with Basie
As Earl Fatha Hines blew our minds
And we grew fonder of Errol Garner
As Eddie Harris bent our ear talkin' bout Listen Here
And Eric Dolphy made his stand
With a side called Ironman
And Gene Ammons told his soul
And we mined Horace's Silver
That bought funky gold
Then Oscar Brown and Joe Williams got down
And we spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around
Spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around
Spun around, spun around, spun around, spun around
And dug Clifford Brown
Wowin' a sweet funky sound of soul
With a rhythm of gold
And along, and along, and along, and along, and along, and along, and along
And along, and along, and along, and along, and along, and along
And along, and along, and along, and along
Came 'trane!
Who blew away all the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain
All the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain, all the pain
In the name of all the Black People on the Planet Earth
And all the stars in the cosmic universe!
As Brother 'trane blew to the East
To destroy the beast
And bring back Peace to Black People!
And everybody heard the majestic word of trane's horn
Telling us of a Love Supreme for Black People
That grew strong, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
From the soul, from the heart
From the spirit, from the brain
From the love of Brother John Coltrane!
Then Jimmy Smith got funky with it
And preached a sermon not to Walk on the Wild Side
But ride with Wes Montgomery
Who played his best everyday in our life
As Shirley Scott's organ got hot
And she and Stanley set more funk free! (Stanley Turrentine)
As Ahmad Jamal played with renewed ability
To give our minds some Tranquility
So that we could listen to an in-soul depth
Brother Archie Shepp
As Jackie McLean broke on the scene
Blowing mean and harder
For everybody to listen to Betty Carter
As Sun Ra shined
And Cannonball's horn whined
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!
So Sonny Stitt started piping it
And we couldn't get enough of brother Jack McDuff
As Freddie Hubbard began to bud
And we heard from Donald Byrd
And they'll be no others like the Ayter Brothers
Then Wayne Shorter grew taller
And our ship left dock with Herbie Hancock
As we rolled with Lee Morgan
And Grooved on Richard Holmes' organ
And then dug the soul of Art Tatum
Produce the sound that made him
As Rufus Harley blew an old new type bagpipe
That put the pants back on the man
An' Nina Simone groaned Mississippi Goddam!l
And Brother McCoy gave us peace and joy
As Elvin bought our freedom Jones down on us! (Elvin Jones)
Then Charles Lloyd filled the void
An' we watched Roland Kirk work!
And with a sigh of relief listened to Yusef Lateef
Blow in a flow of flurry's of peace from the east
As Pharaoh Sanders floated down the Nile with Brother Leon Thomas
To herald the promise of peace and happiness throughout the land!
All praises due to the Creator of the
Blackman!

output/rdf/genius/lyrics_Thats%20a%20Serious%20Thing_Eddie%20Condons%20Hot%20Shots.ttl,Kurt Vonnegut,Slaughterhouse-Five (Chapter 2),"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. Billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day. He has walked through a door in 1955 and come out another one in 1941. He has gone back through that door to find himself in 1963. He has seen his birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the events in between.

He says.

Billy is spastic in time, has no control over where he is going next, and the trips aren't necessarily fun. He is in a constant state of stage fright, he says, because he never knows what part of his life he is going to have to act in next.

Billy was bon in 1922 in Ilium, New York, the only child of a barber there. He was a funny-looking child who became a funny-looking youth-tall and weak, and shaped like a bottle of Coca-Cola. He graduated from Ilium High School in the upper third of his class, and attended night sessions at the Ilium School of Optometry for one semester before being drafted for military service in the Second World War. His father died in a hunting accident during the war. So it goes.

Billy saw service with the infantry in Europe, and was taken prisoner by the Germans. After his honorable discharge from the Army in 1945, Billy again enrolled in the Ilium School of Optometry. During his senior year there, he became engaged to the daughter of the founder and owner of the school, and then suffered a mild nervous collapse.

He was treated in a veterans' hospital near Lake Placid, and was given shock treatments and released. He married his fiancée, finished his 

education, and was set up in business in Ilium by his father-in-law. Ilium is a particularly good city for optometrists because the General Forge and Foundry Company is there. Every employee is required to own a pair of safety glasses, and to wear them in areas where manufacturing is going on. GF&F has sixty-eight thousand employees in Ilium. That calls for a lot of lenses and a lot of frames.

Frames are where the money is.

Billy became rich. He had two children, Barbara and Robert. In time, his daughter Barbara married another optometrist., and Billy set him up in business. Billy's son Robert had a lot of trouble in high school, but then he joined the famous Green Berets. He straightened out, became a fine young man, and he fought in Vietnam.

Early in 1968, a group of optometrists, with Billy among them, chartered an airplane to fly them from Ilium to an international convention of optometrists in Montreal. The plane crashed on top of Sugarbush Mountain, in Vermont. Everybody was killed but Billy. So it goes.

While Billy was recuperating in a hospital in Vermont, his wife died accidentally of carbon-monoxide poisoning. So it goes.

When Billy finally got home to Ilium after the airplane crash, he was quiet for a while. He had a terrible scar across the top of his skull. He didn't resume practice. He had a housekeeper. His daughter came over almost every day.
And then, without any warning, Billy went to New York City, and got on an all-night radio program devoted to talk. He told about having come unstuck in time. He said, too, that he had been kidnapped by a flying saucer in 1967. The saucer was from the planet Tralfamadore, he said. He was taken to Tralfamadore, where he was displayed naked in a zoo, he said. He was mated there with a former Earthling movie star named Montana Wildhack.

Some night owls in Ilium heard Billy on the radio, and one of them called Billy's daughter Barbara. Barbara was upset. She and her husband went down to New York and brought Billy home. Billy insisted mildly that everything he had said on the radio was true. He said he had been kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians on the night of his daughter's wedding. He hadn't been missed, he said, because the Tralfamadorians had taken him through a time warp, so that he could be on Tralfamadore for years, and still be away from Earth for only a microsecond.

Another month went by without incident, and then Billy wrote a letter to the Ilium News Leader, which the paper published. It described the creatures from Tralfamadore.
The letter said that they were two feet high, and green, and shaped like plumber's friends. Their suction cups were on the ground, and their shafts, which were extremely flexible, usually pointed to the sky. At the top of each shaft was a little hand with a green eye in its palm. The creatures were friendly, and they could see in four dimensions. They
Pitied Earthlings for being able to see only three. They had many wonderful things to teach Earthlings, especially about time. Billy promised to tell what some of those wonderful things were in his next letter.

Billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. The second letter started out like this:

'The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.
'When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ""so it goes.""'

And so on.

Billy was working on this letter in the basement rumpus room of his empty house. It was his housekeeper's day off. There was an old typewriter in the rumpus room. It was a beast. It weighed as much as a storage battery. Billy couldn't carry it very far very easily, which was why he was writing in the rumpus room instead of somewhere else.

The oil burner had quit. A mouse had eaten through the insulation of a wire leading to the thermostat. The temperature in the house was down to fifty degrees, but Billy hadn't noticed. He wasn't warmly dressed, either. He was barefoot, and still in his pajamas and a bathrobe, though it was late afternoon. His bare feet were blue and ivory. The cockles of Billy's heart, at any rate, were glowing coals. What made them so hot was Billy's belief that he was going to comfort so many people with the truth about time. His door chimes upstairs had been ringing and ringing. It was his daughter Barbara up there wanting in. Now she let herself in with a key, crossed the floor over his head calling, 'Father? Daddy, where are you?' And so on.

Billy didn't answer her, so she was nearly hysterical, expecting to find his corpse. And then she looked into the very last place there was to look-which was the rumpus room.

'Why didn't you answer me when I called?' Barbara wanted to know, standing there in the door of the rumpus room. She had the afternoon paper with her, the one in which Billy described his friends from Tralfamadore.

'I didn't hear you,' said Billy.
The orchestration of the moment was this: Barbara was only twenty-one years old, but she thought her father was senile, even though he was only forty-six-senile because of damage to his brain in the airplane crash. She also thought that she was head of the family, since she had had to manage her mother's funeral, since she had to get a housekeeper for Billy, and all that. Also, Barbara and her husband were having to look after Billy's business interests, which were considerable, since Billy didn't seem to give a damn for business any more. All this responsibility at such an early age made her a bitchy flibbertigibbet. And Billy, meanwhile, was trying to hang onto his dignity, to persuade Barbara and everybody else that he was far from senile, that, on the contrary, he was devoting himself to a calling much higher than mere business.

He was doing nothing less now, he thought, then prescribing corrective lenses for Earthling souls. So many of those souls were lost and wretched, Billy believed, because they could not see as well as his little green friends on Tralfamadore.

'Don't lie to me, Father,' said Barbara. 'I know perfectly well you heard me when I called.' This was a fairly pretty girl, except that she had legs like an Edwardian grand piano. Now she raised hell with him about the letter in the paper. She said he was making a laughing stock of himself and everybody associated with him.

'Father, Father, Father,' said Barbara, 'what are we going to do with you? Are you going to force us to put you where your mother is?' Billy's mother was still alive. She was in bed in an old people's home called Pine Knoll on the edge of Ilium.

'What is it about my letter that makes you so mad?' Billy wanted to know. 'It's all just crazy. None of it's true! ' 'It's all true. ' Billy's anger was not going to rise with hers. He never got mad at anything. He was wonderful that way. 'There is no such planet as Tralfamadore.'

'It can't be detected from Earth, if that's what you mean,' said Billy. 'Earth can't be detected from Tralfamadore, as far as that goes. They're both very small. They're very far apart.'

'Where did you get a crazy name like ""Tralfamadore?""' 'That's what the creatures who live there call it. 'Oh God,' said Barbara, and she turned her back on him. She celebrated frustration by clapping her hands. 'May I ask you a simple question?' 'Of course.' 'Why is it you never mentioned any of this before the airplane crash?' 'I didn't think the time was ripe.'

And so on. Billy says that he first came unstuck in time in 1944, long before his trip to Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians didn't have anything to do with his coming unstuck They were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on
Billy first came unstuck while the Second World War was in progress. Billy was a chaplain's assistant in the war. A chaplain's assistant is customarily a figure of fun in the American Army. Billy was no exception. He was powerless to harm the enemy or to help his friends. In fact, he had no friends. He was a valet to a preacher, expected no promotions or medals, bore no arms, and had a meek faith in a loving Jesus which most soldiers found putrid.

While on maneuvers in South Carolina, Billy played hymns he knew from childhood, played them on a little black organ which was waterproof. It had thirty-nine keys and two stops-vox humana and vox celeste. Billy also had charge of a portable altar, an olive-drab attaché case with telescoping legs. It was lined with crimson plush, and nestled in that passionate plush were an anodized aluminum cross and a Bible.

The altar and the organ were made by a vacuum-cleaner company in Camden, New Jersey-and said so.

One time on maneuvers Billy was playing 'A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,' with music by Johann Sebastian Bach and words by Martin Luther. It was Sunday morning. Billy and his chaplain had gathered a congregatation of about fifty soldiers on a Carolina hillside. An umpire appeared. There were umpires everywhere, men who said who was winning or losing the theoretical battle, who was alive and who was dead.

The umpire had comical news. The congregation had been theoretically spotted from the air by a theoretical enemy. They were all theoretically dead now. The theoretical corpses laughed and ate a hearty noontime meal.

Remembering this incident years later, Billy was struck by what a Tralfamadorian adventure with death that had been, to be dead and to eat at the same time.
Toward the end of maneuvers., Billy was given an emergency furlough home because his father, a barber in Ilium, New York, was shot dead by a friend while they were out hunting deer. So it goes.

When Billy got back from his furlough., there were orders for him to go overseas. He was needed in the headquarters company of an infantry regiment fighting in Luxembourg. The regimental chaplain's assistant had been killed in action. So it goes.

When Billy joined the regiment, it was in the process of being destroyed by the Germans in the famous Battle of the Bulge. Billy never even got to meet the chaplain he was supposed to assist, was never even issued a steel helmet and combat boots. This was in December of 1944, during the last mighty German attack of the war.

Billy survived, but he was a dazed wanderer far behind the new German lines. Three other wanderers, not quite so dazed, allowed Billy to tag along. Two of them were scouts, and one was an antitank gunner. They were without food or maps. Avoiding Germans they were delivering themselves into rural silences ever more profound. They ate snow.

They went Indian file. First came the scouts, clever, graceful quiet. They had rifles. Next came the antitank gunner, clumsy and dense, warning Germans away with a Colt .45 automatic in one hand and a trench knife in the other.

Last came Billy Pilgrim, empty-handed, bleakly ready for death. Billy was Preposterous-six feet and three inches tall, with a chest and shoulders like a box of kitchen matches. He had no helmet, no overcoat, no weapon and no boots. On his feet were cheap, low-cut civilian shoes which he had bought for his father's funeral. Billy had lost a heel, which made him bob up-and-down, up-and-down. The involuntary dancing up and down, up and down, made his hip joints sore.

Billy was wearing a thin field jacket, a shirt and trousers of scratchy wool, and long underwear that was soaked with sweat. He was the only one of the four who had a beard. It was a random, bristly beard, and some of the bristles were white, even though
Billy was only twenty-one years old. He was also going bald. Wind and cold and violent exercise had turned his face crimson
He didn't look like a soldier at all. He looked like a filthy flamingo.

And on the third day of wandering, somebody shot at the four from far away-shot four times as they crossed a narrow brick road. One shot was for the scouts. The next one was for the antitank gunner, whose name was Roland Weary.

The third bullet was for the filthy flamingo, who stopped dead center in the road when the lethal bee buzzed past his ear. Billy stood there politely, giving the marksman another chance. It was his addled understanding of the rules of warfare that the marksman should be given a second chance. The next shot missed Billy's kneecaps by inches, going end- on-end, from the sound of it.

Roland Weary and the scouts were safe in a ditch, and Weary growled at Billy, 'Get out of the road, you dumb motherfucker.' The last word was still a novelty in the speech of white people in 1944. It was fresh and astonishing to Billy, who had never fucked anybody-and it did its job. It woke him up and got him off the road.

'Saved your life again, you dumb bastard,' Weary said to Billy in the ditch. He had been saving Billy's life for days, cursing him, kicking him, slapping him, making him move. It was absolutely necessary that cruelty be used, because Billy wouldn't do anything to save himself. Billy wanted to quit. He was cold, hungry, embarrassed, incompetent. He could scarcely distinguish between sleep and wakefulness now, on the third day, found no important differences either, between walking and standing still
He wished everybody would leave him alone. 'You guys go on without me,' he said again and again.

Weary was as new to war as Billy. He was a replacement, too. As a part of a gun crew, he had helped to fire one shot in anger-from a 57-millimeter antitank gun. The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of a zipper on the fly of God Almighty. The gun lapped up snow and vegetation with a blowtorch feet long. The flame left a black arrow on the ground, showing the Germans exactly where the gun was hidden. The shot was a miss.

What had been missed was a Tiger tank. It swiveled its 88-millimeter snout around sniffingly, saw the arrow on the ground. It fired. It killed everybody on the gun crew but Weary. So it goes.

Roland Weary was only eighteen, was at the end of an unhappy childhood spent mostly in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He had been unpopular in Pittsburgh. He had been unpopular because he was stupid and fat and mean, and smelled like bacon no matter how much he washed. He was always being ditched in Pittsburgh by people who did not want him with them.

It made Weary sick to be ditched. When Weary was ditched, he would find somebody who was even more unpopular than himself, and he would horse around with that person for a while, pretending to be friendly. And then he would find some pretext for beating the shit out of him.

It was a pattern. It was a crazy, sexy, murderous relationship Weary entered into with people he eventually beat up. He told hem about his father's collection of guns and swords and torture instruments and leg irons and so on. Weary's father, who was a plumber, actually did collect such things, and his collection was insured for four thousand dollars. He wasn't alone. He belonged to a big club composed of people who collected things like that.

Weary's father once gave Weary's mother a Spanish thumbscrew in--working condition--for a kitchen paperweight. Another time he gave her a table lamp whose base was a model one foot high of the famous 'Iron Maiden of Nuremburg.' The real Iron Maiden was a medieval torture instrument, a sort of boiler which was shaped like a woman on the outside-and lined with spikes. The front of the woman was composed of two hinged doors. The idea was to put a criminal inside and then close the doors slowly. There were two special spikes where his eyes would be. There was a drain in the bottom to let out all the blood.

So it goes.

Weary had told Billy Pilgrim about the Iron Maiden, about the drain in the bottom-and what that was for. He had talked to Billy about dum-dums. He told him about his father's Derringer pistol, which could be carried in a vest pocket, which was yet capable of making a hole in a man 'which a bull bat could fly through without touching either wing.'

Weary scornfully bet Billy one time that he didn't even know what a blood gutter was. Billy guessed that it was the drain in the bottom of the Iron Maiden, but that was wrong. A blood gutter, Billy learned, was the shallow groove in the side of the blade of a sword or bayonet.

Weary told Billy about neat tortures he'd read about or seen in the movies or heard on the radio-about other neat tortures he himself had invented. One of the inventions was sticking a dentist's drill into a guy's ear. He asked Billy what he thought the worst form of execution was. Billy had no opinion. The correct answer turned out to be this: 'You stake a guy out on an anthill in the desert-see? He's face upward, and you put honey all over his balls and pecker, and you cut off his eyelids so he has to stare at the sun till he dies.' So it goes.

Now, lying in the ditch with Billy and the scouts after having been shot at, Weary made Billy take a very close look at his trench knife. It wasn't government issue. It was a present from his father. It had a ten-inch blade that was triangular 'in 'cross section. Its grip consisted of brass knuckles, was a chain of rings through which Weary slipped his stubby fingers. The rings weren't simple. They bristled with spikes.

Weary laid the spikes along Billy's cheek, roweled the cheek with savagely affectionate restraint. 'How'd you-like to be hit with this-hm? Hmmmmmmmmm?' he wanted to know.

'I wouldn't,' said Billy. 'Know why the blade's triangular?' 'No.' 'Makes a wound that won't close up.' 'Oh.' 'Makes a three-sided hole in a guy. You stick an ordinary knife in a guy-makes a slit, right? A slit closes right up. Right? 'Right.'

'Shit. What do you know? What the hell they teach you in college?'

'I wasn't there very long.' said Billy, which was true. He had had only six months of

college and

the college hadn't been a regular college, either. It had been the night school of the Ilium School of Optometry.

""Joe College,' said Weary scathingly. Billy shrugged.

'There's more to life than what you read in books.' said Weary. 'You'll find that out.'

Billy made no reply to this, either, there in the ditch, since he didn't want the conversation to go on any longer than necessary. He was dimly tempted to say, though, that he knew a thing or two about gore. Billy, after all, had contemplated torture and hideous wounds at the beginning and the end of nearly every day of his childhood. Billy had an extremely gruesome crucifix hanging on the wall of his little bedroom in Ilium. A military surgeon would have admired the clinical fidelity of the artist's rendition of all Christ's wounds-the spear wound, the thorn wounds, the holes that were made by the iron spikes. Billy's Christ died horribly. He was pitiful.

So it goes.

Billy wasn't a Catholic, even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on the wall. His father had no religion. His mother was a substitute organist for several churches around town. She took Billy with her whenever she played, taught him to play a little, too. She said she was going to join a church as soon as she decided which one was right.

She never did decide. She did develop a terrific hankering for a crucifix, though. And she bought one from a Sante Fé gift shop during a trip the little family made out West during the Great Depression. Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.

And the crucifix went up on the wall of Billy Pilgrim.

The two scouts, loving the walnut stocks of their rifles in the ditch, whispered that it was time to move out again. Ten minutes had gone by without anybody's coming to see if they were hit or not, to finish them off. Whoever had shot was evidently far away and all alone.

And the four crawled out of the ditch without drawing any more fire. They crawled into a forest like the big, unlucky mammals they were. Then they stood up and began to walk quickly. The forest was dark and cold. The pines were planted in ranks and files. There was no undergrowth. Four inches of unmarked snow blanketed the ground. The Americans had no choice but to leave trails in the show as unambiguous as diagrams in a book on ballroom dancing--step, slide, rest-step, slide, rest.

'Close it up and keep it closed!' Roland Weary warned Billy Pilgrim as they moved out. Weary looked like Tweedledum or Tweedledee, all bundled up for battle. He was short and thick.

He had every piece of equipment he had ever been issued, every present he'd received from home: helmet, helmet liner, wool cap, scarf, gloves, cotton undershirt, woolen undershirt, wool shirt, sweater, blouse, jacket, overcoat, cotton underpants, woolen underpants, woolen trousers, cotton socks, woolen socks, combat boots, gas mask, canteen, mess kit, first-aid kit, trench knife, blanket, shelter-half, raincoat, bulletproof Bible, a pamphlet entitled 'Know Your Enemy,' another pamphlet entitled 'Why We Fight' and another pamphlet of German phrases rendered in English phonetics, which would enable Weary to ask Germans questions such as 'Where is your headquarters?' and 'How many howitzers have you?' Or to tell them, 'Surrender. Your situation is hopeless,' and so on.

Weary had a block of balsa wood which was supposed to be a foxhole pillow. He had a prophylactic kit containing two tough condoms 'For the Prevention of Disease Only!' He had a whistle he wasn't going to show anybody until he got promoted to corporal. He had a dirty picture of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland pony. He had made Billy Pilgrim admire that picture several times.

The woman and the pony were posed before velvet draperies which were fringed with deedlee-balls. They were flanked by Doric columns. In front of one column was a potted palm. The Picture that Weary had was a print of the first dirty photograph in history. The word photography was first used in 1839, and it was in that year, too, that Louis J. M. Daguerre revealed to the French Academy that an image formed on a silvered metal plate covered with a thin film of silver iodide could be developed in the presence of mercury vapor.

In 1841, only two years later, an assistant to Daguerre, André Le Fèvre, was arrested in the Tuileries Gardens for attempting to sell a gentleman a picture of the woman and the pony. That was where Weary bought his picture, too-in the Tuileries. Le Fèvre argued that the picture was fine art, and that his intention was to make Greek mythology come alive. He said that columns and the potted palm proved that.

When asked which myth he meant to represent, Le Fèvre replied that there were thousands of myths like that, with the woman a mortal and the pony a god.

He was sentenced to six months in prison. He died there of pneumonia. So it goes.

Billy and the Scouts were skinny people. Roland Weary had fat to burn. He was a roaring furnace under all his layers of wool and straps and canvas. He had so much energy that he bustled back and forth between Billy and the scouts, delivering dumb messages which nobody had sent and which nobody was pleased to receive. He also began to suspect, since he was so much busier than anybody else, that he was the leader.

He was so hot and bundled up, in fact, that he had no sense of danger. His vision of the outside world was limited to what he could see through a narrow slit between the rim of his helmet and his scarf from home, which concealed his baby face from the bridge of his nose on down. He was so snug in there that he was able to pretend that he was safe at home, having survived the war, and that he was telling his parents and his sister a true war story-whereas the true war story was still going on.

Weary's version of the true war story went like this: There was a big German attack, and Weary and his antitank buddies fought like hell until everybody was killed but Weary. So it goes. And then Weary tied in with two scouts, and they became close friends immediately, and they decided to fight them way back to their own lines. They were going to travel fast. They were damned if they'd surrender. They shook hands all around. They called themselves 'The Three Musketeers.'

But then this damn college kid, who was so weak he shouldn't even have been in the army, asked if he could come along. He didn't even have a gun or a knife. He didn't even have a helmet or a cap. He couldn't even walk right-kept bobbing up-and down, up-and- down, driving everybody crazy, giving their position away. He was pitiful. The Three Musketeers pushed and carried and dragged the college kid all the way back to their own lines, Weary's story went. They saved his God-damned hide for him.

In real life, Weary was retracing his steps, trying to find out what had happened to Billy. He had told the scouts to wait while he went back for the college bastard. He passed under a low branch now. It hit the top of his helmet with a clonk. Weary didn't
Hear it. Somewhere a big dog was barking. Weary didn't hear that, either. His war story was at a very exciting point. An officer was congratulating the Three Musketeers, telling them that he was going to put them in for Bronze Stars.

'Anything else I can do for you boys?' said the officer.

'Yes, sir,' said one of the scouts. 'We'd like to stick together for the rest of the war, sir. Is there some way you can fix it so nobody will ever break up the Three Musketeers?'

Billy Pilgrim had stopped in the forest. He was leaning against a tree with his eyes closed. His head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. He was like a poet in the Parthenon.

This was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through the full arc of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn't anybody else there, or any thing. There was just violet light and a hum. And then Billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-birth, which was red light and bubbling sounds. And then he swung into life again and stopped. He was a little boy taking a shower with his hairy father at the Ilium Y.M.C.A. He smelled chlorine from the swimming pool next door, heard the springboard boom.

Little Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swim by the method of sink-or-swim. Ms father was going to throw Billy into the deep end, and Billy was going to damn well swim.

It was like an execution. Billy was numb as his father carried him from the shower room to the pool. His eyes were closed. When he opened his eyes, he was on the bottom of the pool, and there was beautiful music everywhere. He lost consciousness, but the music went on. He dimly sensed that somebody was rescuing him. Billy resented that.

From there he traveled in time to 1965. He was forty-one years old, and he was visiting his decrepit mother at Pine Knoll, an old people's home he had put her in only a month before. She had caught pneumonia, and wasn't expected to live. She did live, though, for years after that.

Her voice was nearly gone, so, in order to hear her, Billy had to put his ear right next to her papery lips. She evidently had something very important to say.

'How ...?' she began, and she stopped. She was too tired. She hoped that she wouldn’t have to say the rest of the sentence, and that Billy would finish it for her.

But Billy had no idea what was on her mind. 'How what, Mother?' he prompted.

She swallowed hard, shed some tears. Then she gathered energy from all over her ruined body, even from her toes and fingertips. At last she had accumulated enough to whisper this complete sentence:

'How did I get so old? '

Billy's antique mother passed out, and Billy was led from the room by a pretty nurse. The body of an old man covered by a sheet was wheeled by just as Billy entered the corridor. The man had been a famous marathon runner in his day. So it goes. This was before Billy had his head broken in an airplane crash, by the way-before he became so vocal about flying saucers and traveling in time.

Billy sat down in a waiting room. He wasn't a widower yet. He sensed something hard under the cushion of his overstuffed chair. He dug it out, discovered that it was a book, The Execution of Private Slovik, by William Bradford Huie. It was a true account of the death before an American firing squad of private Eddie D. Slovik, 36896415, the only American soldier to be shot for cowardice since the Civil War. So it goes.

Billy read the opinion of a staff judge advocate who reviewed Slovik's case, which ended like this: He has directly challenged the authority of the government, and future discipline depends upon a resolute reply to this challenge. If the death penalty is ever to be imposed for desertion, it should be imposed in this case, not as a punitive measure nor as retribution, but to maintain that discipline upon which alone an army can succeed against the enemy. There was no recommendation for clemency in the case and none is here recommended. So it goes.

Billy blinked in 1965, traveled in time to 1958. He was at a banquet in honour of a Little League team of which his son Robert was a member. The coach, who had never been married, was speaking. He was all choked up. 'Honest to God,' he was Saying, 'I'd consider it an honor just to be water boy for these kids.'

Billy blinked in 1958, traveled in time to 1961. It was New Year's Eve, and Billy was disgracefully drunk at a party where everybody was in optometry or married to an optometrist.

Billy usually didn't drink much, because the war had ruined his stomach, but he certainly had a snootful now, and he was being unfaithful to his wife Valencia for the first and only time. He had somehow persuaded a woman to come into the laundry room of the house, and then sit up on the gas dryer, which was running.

The woman was very drunk herself, and she helped Billy get her girdle off. 'What was it you wanted to talk about?' she said.

'It's all night,' said Billy. He honestly thought it was all right. He couldn't remember the name of the woman.

'How come they call you Billy instead of William?' 'Business reasons,' said Billy. That was true. His father-in-law, who owned the Ilium School of Optometry, who had set Billy up in practice, was a genius in his field. He told Billy to encourage people to call him Billy-because it would stick in their memories. It would also make him seem slightly magical, since there weren't any other grown Billys around. It also compelled people to think of him as a friend right away.

Somewhere in there was an awful scene, with people expressing disgust for Billy and the woman, and Billy found himself out in his automobile, trying to find the steering wheel.

The main thing now was to find the steering wheel. At first, Billy windmilled his arms, hoping to find it by luck. When that didn't work, he became methodical, working in such a way that the wheel could not possibly escape him. He placed himself hard against the left-hand door, searched every square inch of the area before him. When he failed to find the wheel, he moved over six inches, and searched again. Amazingly, he was eventually hard against the right-hand door, without having found the wheel.

He concluded that somebody had stolen it. This angered him as he passed out.

He was in the back seat of his car, which was why he couldn't find the steering wheel.

Now somebody was shaking Billy awake. Billy still felt drunk, was still angered by the stolen steering wheel. He was back in the Second World War again, behind the German lines. The person who was shaking him was Roland Weary. Weary had gathered the front of Billy's field jacket into his hands. He banged Billy against a tree, then puffed him away from it, flung him in the direction he was supposed to take under his own power.

Billy stopped, shook his head. 'You go on,' he said. 'What? ' 'You guys go on without me. I'm all right.' 'You're what?'

'I'm O.K.'

'Jesus-I'd hate to see somebody sick,' said Weary, through five layers of humid scarf from home. Billy had never seen Weary's face. He had tried to imagine it one time, had imagined a toad in a fishbowl.

Weary kicked and shoved Billy for a quarter of a mile. The scouts were waiting between the banks of a frozen creek. They had heard the dog. They had heard men calling back and forth, too-calling like hunters who had a pretty good idea of where their quarry was.

The banks of the creek were high enough to allow the scouts to stand without being seen. Billy staggered down the bank ridiculously. After him came Weary, clanking and clinking and tinkling and hot.

'Here he is, boys,' said Weary. 'He don't want to live, but he's gonna live anyway. When he gets out of this, by God, he's gonna owe his life to the Three Musketeers. '

Billy Pilgrim, there in the creekbed, thought he, Billy Pilgrim, was turning to steam painlessly. If everybody would leave him alone for just a little while, he thought, he wouldn't cause anybody any more trouble. He would turn to steam and float up among the treetops.

Somewhere the big dog barked again. With the help of fear and echoes and winter silences, that dog had a voice like a big bronze gong.

Roland Weary, eighteen years old, insinuated himself between the scouts, draped a heavy arm around the shoulder of each. 'So what do the Three Musketeers do now?' he said.

Billy Pilgrim was having a delightful hallucination. He was wearing dry, warm, white sweatsocks, and he was skating on a ballroom floor. Thousands cheered. This wasn't time-travel. It had never happened, never would happen. It was the craziness of a dying young man with his shoes full of snow.

One scout hung his head, let spit fall from his lips. The other did the same. They studied the infinitesimal effects of spit on snow and history. They were small, graceful people. They had been behind German lines before many times--living like woods creatures, living from moment to moment in useful terror, thinking brainlessly with their spinal cords.

Now they twisted out from under Weary's loving arms. They told Weary that he and Billy had better find somebody to surrender to. The Scouts weren't going to wait for them any more.

And they ditched Weary and Billy in the creekbed.

Billy Pilgrim went on skating, doing tricks in sweat-socks, tricks that most people would consider impossible-making turns, stopping on a dime and so on. The cheering went on, but its tone was altered as the hallucination gave way to time-travel
Billy stopped skating, found himself at a lectern in a Chinese restaurant in Ilium, New York, on an early afternoon in the autumn of 1957. He was receiving a standing ovation from the Lions Club. He had just been elected President, and it was necessary that he speak. He was scared stiff, thought a ghastly mistake had been made. All those prosperous, solid men out there would discover now that they had elected a ludicrous waif. They would hear his reedy voice, the one he'd had in the war. He swallowed, knew that all he -had for a voice box was a little whistle cut from a willow switch. Worse-he had nothing to say. The crowd quieted down. Everybody was pink and beaming.

Billy opened his mouth, and out came a deep, resonant tone. His voice was a gorgeous instrument. It told jokes which brought down the house. It grew serious, told jokes again, and ended on a note of humility. The explanation of the miracle was this: Billy had taken a course in public speaking.

And then he was back in the bed of the frozen creek again. Roland Weary was about to beat the living shit out of him.

Weary was filled with a tragic wrath. He had been ditched again. He stuffed his pistol into its holster. He slipped his knife into its scabbard. Its triangular blade and blood gutters on all three faces. And then he shook Billy hard, rattled his skeleton, slammed him against a bank.

Weary barked and whimpered through his layers of scarf from home. He spoke unintelligibly of the sacrifices he had made on Billy's behalf. He dilated upon the piety and heroism of 'The Three Musketeers,' portrayed, in the most glowing and impassioned hues, their virtue and magnanimity, the imperishable honor they acquired for themselves, and the great services they rendered to Christianity.

It was entirely Billy's fault that this fighting organization no longer existed, Weary felt, and Billy was going to pay. Weary socked Billy a good one on the side of the jaw, knocked Billy away from the bank and onto the snow-covered ice of the creek. Billy was down on all fours on the ice, and Weary kicked him in the ribs, rolled him over on his side. Billy tried to form himself into a ball.

'You shouldn't even be in the Army,' said Weary.

Billy was involuntarily making convulsive sounds that were a lot like laughter. 'You think it's funny, huh?' Weary inquired. He walked around to Billy's back. Billy's jacket and shirt and undershirt had been hauled up around his shoulders by the violence, so his back was naked. There, inches from the tips of Weary's combat boots, were the pitiful buttons of Billy's spine.

Weary drew back his right boot, aimed a kick at the spine, at the tube which had so many of Billy's important wires in it. Weary was going to break that tube.

But then Weary saw that he had an audience. Five German soldiers and a police dog on a leash were looking down into the bed of the creek. The soldiers' blue eyes were filled with bleary civilian curiosity as to why one American would try to murder another one so far from home, and why the victim should laugh.2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
