        xyz:lyrics    "JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK\n\nScreenplay by\n\nKevin Smith\n\n\n\nOVER BLACK WE SEE:\n\nCHYRON\n\nA long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far\naway--\n\nEXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY\n\nWe FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from\nsometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK --\na 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A\nwhite-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap\ncomes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an\noversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe,\nand messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in\nthe Mother's hands.\nMOTHER\nBobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks\nup the free cheese, 'kay?\n\nShe looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly,\nthen looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her\nbaseball cap and places it on the baby.\n\nMOTHER\nThis'll keep the sun out of your\neyes. You be good now.\n\nShe walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall.\nWith the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his\nmouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks\nkind of familiar.\n\nThen, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS\nconcert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair\nenters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip.\nShe sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets\nher Baby down beside him.\n\nMOTHER\nDon't fucking move, you little shit-\nmachine. Mommy's gonna try to score.\nA PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He\ntakes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the\nrecord store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.\n\nPASSERBY\nExcuse me--who's watching these\nbabies?\n\nMOTHER\nThe fat one's watching the little\none.\n\nPASSERBY\nOh, nice parenting.\n(walking away)\nLeave'em out here like that and see\nwhat happens.\n\nThe Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.\n\nMOTHER\nFUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!\n\nPASSERBY\n(waving her off)\nAh, keep on truckin'.\nMOTHER\n(to baby)\nD'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me\nhow to fuckin' raise you?\nMotherfucker, man! Who's he fucking\nthink he is? What's the worse fuckin'\nthing could happen to you sitting\noutside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!\n\nThe door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat.\nThen, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing.\nThe smaller one says--\n\nBABY\nFuck, fuck, fuck...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE PRESENT\n\nJAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record\nRack is now RST VIDEO.\n\nJay is mid-chant.\n\nJAY\n(as a chant)\n--fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother\nfuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-\nfuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,\nnoinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed,\nsmoking weed, doing coke, drinking\nbeers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers,\nrolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who\nsmokes the blunts? We smoke the\nblunts!\n\nA pair of TEENS approach them.\n\nTEEN 1\nLemme get a nickel bag.\n\nJAY\nFifteen bucks, little man. Put that\nshit in my hand. If the money does\nnot show, then you owe-me-owe-me-\nowe.\n(changing up to Morris\nDay)\nMy Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh!\nI think I want to know ya', know ya'--\n\nTEEN 1\n(digging in pockets)\nWhat the hell are you singing?\n\nJAY\nYou don't know \"Jungle Love\"? That\nshit is the mad notes. Written by\nGod Herself and handed down to the\nworld's greatest band--the\nmotherfucking Time.\n\nTEEN 2\nThe guys in that Prince movie?\n\nTEEN 1\nPurple Rain.\n\nTEEN 2\nMan, that shit was so gay--fucking\neighties style.\n\nJay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against\nthe wall.\n\nJAY\nBitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind\nword about The Time! Me and Silent\nBob modeled our whole fucking lives\nafter Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a\nsmooth pimp who loves the pussy, and\nTubby here's my black manservant!\n\nJust then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door\nbehind him.\n\nRANDAL\nWhat'd I tell you two about dealing\nin front of the store? Drop the kid\nand peddle your wares someplace else,\nburn-boy.\n(walking away)\nAnd for the record, The Time sucked\nass.\n\nHe exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After\na beat--\n\nJAY\nYo-youse guys wanna hear something\nfucked up about him and the Quick\nStop guy?\n\nINT. QUICK STOP-DAY\n\nRandal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a\ncustomer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the\ncounter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a\nnewspaper.\n\nRANDAL\nHey, can't we do something about\nthose two stoners hanging around\noutside all the time?\n\nDANTE\nWhy? What'd they do now?\n\nRANDAL\nI'm trying to watch Clash of the\nTitans, and all I can hear is the\ntwo them screaming about Morris Day\nat the top of their lungs.\n\nDANTE\nI thought the fat one didn't really\ntalk much.\n\nRANDAL\nWhat, am I producing an A&E Biography\nabout 'em? I'm just saying they\nshouldn't be loitering around the\nstores like they do.\n\nDANTE\nNeither should you, but we let you\nstay.\n\nRANDAL\nSee, man--if you were funnier than\nthat, ABC never would've canceled\nus.\n\nDANTE\nWhat?\n\nRANDAL\nNothing.\n\nEnter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling.\n\nTEEN 1\nTwo packs of Wraps.\n(beat)\nYo--how was the service?\n\nRANDAL\nWhat service?\n\nTEEN 2\nThe one at the Unitarian church where\nyou two got married to each other\nlast week.\n\nRANDAL\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\n\nTEEN 1\nJay said you had a Star-Wars--themed\nwedding and you guys tied the knot\ndressed like storm troopers.\n\nTEEN 2\nYeah. And he said you're the bitch\nand you're the butch. Oh, sorry--the\nLeia and the Luke.\n\nDANTE\nI'm the bitch?!\n\nRANDAL\nWell if we were gay, that's how I'd\nsee it.\n\nDANTE\nWould you shut up?!\n\nTEEN 1\n(to TEEN 2)\nHoly shit, dude. The honeymoon's\nover.\n\nDANTE\nWe're not married to each other.\n\nTEEN 1\nWell, sure. Not in the eyes of the\nstate or any real church, Skywalker.\n\nRANDAL\n(heading for the phone)\nThat does it. I'm gonna do something\nabout those two. I shoulda done a\nlong time ago\n\nTEEN 2\nIn a galaxy far, far away!\n\nTEEN 1\n(exiting)\nMay the Foreskin be with you. Hand\nJabba the Hutt.\n\nRANDAL\n(into phone)\nYeah, I want to report a couple of\ndrug dealers out in front of the\nQuick Stop.\n\nEXT. QUICK STOP--DAY\n\nJay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a\nCOP, who frisks them.\n\nJAY\nWhat the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we\ndo?\n\nCOP\nWe got a report that two guys were\nhanging around outside the stores,\nselling pot?\n\nJAY\nWe don't smoke pot, yo.\n\nTeen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.\n\nTEEN 1\nHere're the rolling papers you wanted\nfor your pot. And your change. Thanks.\n(getting in Jay's\nface)\nAnd The Time sucks ass!\n\nTeen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop\nstops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand.\nHe eyeballs the pair.\n\nCOP\nNo pot, hunh? What do you need this\nfor?\n\nJAY\nWhat?  I got a wiping problem. I\nstick these little pieces of paper\nover my brown-eye, and bam--no shit\nstains in my undies.\n(unbuttoning pants)\nYou don't believe me? Lemme show\nyou.\n\nJay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back\nover his shoulder.\n\nJAY\nJust spread my cheeks a little and\nyou can see the fucking stink nuggets--\n\nCOP\nPull up your pants up sir, Now!\n\nJay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob\ncracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the\ncar.\n\nCOP\nLet's take a ride down to the station.\n\nJAY\nWhat? It's suddenly a crime to fart,\nmotherfucker?!\n\nEXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY\n\nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red\nBank.\n\nBRODIE (O.S.)\nNo fucking way!\n\nWE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--\n\nINT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER\n\nBRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a\nDixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he\nputs new books in the racks.\n\nBRODIE\nDante and Randal slapped you with a\nrestraining order?!\n\nJAY\nJudge said if we go within a hundred\nfeet of the stores, we get thrown\ninto County.\n\nBRODIE\nSo you gonna abide by the court's\nruling or you gonna go Bandit--\nReynolds style?\n\nJAY\nFuck yeah! You know what they make\nyou do in county? Toss the fucking\nsalad! I don't like this fuck's\nasshole; I'm gonna do it for some\nstranger?\n\nBRODIE\nI guess if you really wanted to hang\nout in from of a convenience store,\nyou could just buy your own now--\nwhat with all that money you guys\nmade.\n\nJAY\nHell yeah, bitch.\n(beat)\nWait a second--what money?\n\nBRODIE\nThe money from the movie, dumb-ass.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you babbling about?\n\nBRODIE\n(pulling a bagged-and-\nboarded issue down\nfrom the wall)\nThe Bluntman and Chronic movie.\n(dawns on him)\nOh my God--don't tell me you have no\nidea there's a movie being made of\nthe comic you two were the basis\nfor.\n\nJAY\nWhat?! Since when?\n\nBRODIE\nGoddamit, man--\n(taps his wrist)\nHere's the pulse, alright. And here's\nyour finger--\n(shoves his hand down\nthe back of his pants)\n--far from the pulse, jammed straight\nup your ass.\n(extracts hand and\nextends it to Jay)\nSay--would you like a chocolate\ncovered pretzel?\n\nBrodie leads them back to the counter.\n\nBRODIE\nYou see, kids, if you read Wizard,\nyou'd know it's the top story this\nmonth.  Check it out.\n\nBrodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to\nthe headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get\nBig Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL\nAND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and\nChronic.\n\nJAY\nWhen the fuck did this happen?!\n\nBRODIE\nWell, after X-Men hit at the box\noffice, all the studios started buying\nup every comic property they could\nget their hands on. Miramax optioned\nBluntman and Chronic.\n\nJAY\nMiramax? I thought they only made\nclassy flicks like The Piano and The\nCrying Game?\n\nBRODIE\nYeah, well once they made She's All\nThat, everything went to hell. So\nyou're saying you haven't gotten a\ncut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil\nand Banky Edwards used to pay you\nlikeness rights for the comic book?\n\nJAY\nWe haven't seen a fucking dime for\nno movie!\n\nBRODIE\nWell boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think\nHolden and Banky owe you some of the\nproverbial phat cash. I mean they're\nmaking a movie based on characters\nthat are based on you and Quiet\nRobert.\n\nJAY\nIt ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a\npair of stupid-ass superheroes that\nrun around saying \"Snitchy-Nitchies\"\nor something.\n\nBRODIE\nI believe it \"Snootchie Boochies.\"\nRegardless--you're getting screwed.\nIf I was you guys, I'd confront Holden\nMcNeil and ask him for my movie check.\n\nJAY\nShit yeah. We gotsa get paid.\n\nBRODIE\nAnd on that note, we cue the music.\n\nJay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with\nhis own beat.\n\nEXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY\n\nJay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building\nand knock.\n\nINT. POTZER'S INC--DAY\n\nHolden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.\n\nHOLDEN\nWell! I have been waiting years to\ndo this.\n(smiles)\nLook at these morose motherfuckers\nright here. Smells like someone shit\nin their cereal. Bunngg!\n\nJay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following\nthem.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck took you so long\nanswering your damn door? You trying\nto talk another girlfriend of yours\ninto some of that gay-ass three-way\naction with your buddy?\n\nHOLDEN\nNo, I was just showering your mother's\nstink off me after I gave her a quick\njump and sent her home. But now that\nyou mention it--\n(to Bob)\nThanks, you know. You could've made\nthe moral of that story you told me\na bit more clear.\n\nSilent Bob shrugs.\n\nHOLDEN\nSo what brings you two dirt merchants\nto my neck of the woods?\n\nJAY\nOh, I'll tell you what our necks are\ndoing in your woods--\n\nSilent Bob holds up the Wizard article.\n\nJAY\nWhere's our motherfucking movie check?\n\nHOLDEN\nYou heard about that too, Hunh? Well,\nI've got nothing to do with it. That's\nBanky's deal. He owns the property\nnow. I signed my half of the Bluntman\nand Chronic right over to him years\nago.\n\nJAY\nWhy the fuck would you do a thing\nlike that?\n\nHOLDEN\nBecause I'm almost thirty, for God's\nsake--why on earth would I want to\nkeep writing about characters whose\ncentral preoccupations are weed and\ndick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,\nman. Don't you ever want more for\nyourself?\n(off Silent Bob)\nI know this poor, hapless sonovabitch\ndoes. I look in his doe eyes and I\nsee a man crying out, \"When, Lord?\nWhen the fuck can your servant ditch\nthis foul-mouthed little chucklehead\nto whom I am a constant victim of\nhis folly, and who bombards me and\nthose around us with grade-A\nfoolishness that prevents me from\neven getting to kiss a girl? Fuck!\nWhen?!\n\nSilent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at\nhim, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.\n\nJAY\nI'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're\nthe dumb-ass who gave away his comic,\nand now you ain't got no fat movie\ncheck neither.\n\nHOLDEN\nWhen you're right, you're right. I\nwish I'd broken off a little piece\nfor myself. Because if the buzz is\nany indication, the movie's gonna\nmake some huge bank.\n\nJAY\nWhat buzz?\n\nHOLDEN\nThe Internet buzz.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck is the Internet?\n\nINT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER\n\nHolden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look\nover his shoulder.\n\nHOLDEN\nThe Internet is a communication device\nthat allows people the world over to\nbitch about movies and share\npornography with one another.\n(off monitor)\nHere's what we're looking for: \"Movie\nPoopShoot.com\"\n\nJAY\n(to Bob)\n\"PoopChute.\" Yeaaahhh.\n\nHOLDEN\nThis is a site full of militant movie\nbuffs: sad bastards who live in their\nparents' basements, downloading\nscripts and trading what they believe\nto be inside info about movies and\nactors they despise yet can't stop\ndiscussing. This is where you go if\nyou wanna hear frustrated would-be\nfilmmakers mouth off with their two-\nbit, arm-chair-director's opinions\non how they all could've made a better\nEpisode One.\n\nOn the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up.\nHolden begins navigating the site.\n\nHOLDEN\nHere. This is about the Bluntman\nmovie.\n(reading)\n\"Inside sources tell me Miramax is\nstarting production this Friday on\ntheir adaptation of underground comic\nfave Bluntman and Chronic.\"\n\nJAY\nFriday?! Shit. Does it say who's\nplaying us in the movie?\n\nHOLDEN\nNo, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure\nit'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.\nThey put'em in a bunch of movies.\n\nJAY\nWho?\n\nHOLDEN\nYou know--the guys from Good Will\nHunting.\n\nJAY\nYou mean the fucking movie with Mork\nfrom Ork in it?\n\nHOLDEN\nYeah, I'm not too big a fan either.\nThough Affleck was the bomb in\nPhantoms.\n\nJAY\nWord, bitch. Phantoms like a\nmotherfucker.\n\nHolden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again.\n\nHOLDEN\nNow down here is where you can gauge\nthe buzz. This is the Shoot Back\narea. It's where people who read the\nnews get to chime in with their two\ncents. Here's what a guy who goes by\nthe chick-magnet Net handle of \"Wampa-\nOne\" thinks about Bluntman and\nChronic.\n(reading)\n\"Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid\nalter egos Jay and Silent Bob only\nwork in small doses, if at all. They\ndon't deserve their own movie.\"\n(to Jay)\nHe's got a point.\n\nJAY\nFuck him. What's the next one say?\n\nHOLDEN\n(reading)\n\"Bluntman and Chronic is the worst\ncomic I ever read. Jay and Silent\nBob are stupid characters. A couple\nof stoners who spout dumb-ass\ncatchphrases like a third-rate Cheech\nand Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay\nand Silent Bob. Fuck them up their\nstupid asses.\"\n\nJAY\nWho the fuck said that shit?!\n\nHOLDEN\nA guy who calls himself \"Magnolia-\nFan.\"  Check out what the guy after\nhim said: \"Jay and Silent Bob are\nterrible, one-note jokes that only\nstoners laugh at.  They're fucking\nclown shoes. If they were real, I'd\nbeat the shit out of them for being\nso stupid. I can't believe Miramax\nwould have anything to so with this\nshit. I, for one, will be boycotting\nthis movie. Who's with me?\"\n(leans back)\nAnd then there are about fifty more\nposts from people who agree to join\nSpartacus-here's boycott of the flick.\n\nJAY\n(grimly)\nI'm gonna kill all these fucks--\n\nHOLDEN\nAh, let it go. Number one, they're a\nbunch of jealous little dicks who\nuse the anonymity of the Net to insult\npeople who're doing what they wish\nthey were doing, and number two,\nthey're not really talking about you\nguys--they talking about Bluntman\nand Chronic.\n\nJAY\nBut they said Jay and Silent Bob!\nThey used our real names. It doesn't\nmatter that there's a comic book\nversion of us and a real version,\n'cause nobody knows we're real in\nreal life.\n\nHOLDEN\nReally.\n\nJAY\nYeah! And all these people who read\nthat shit think the real Jay and\nSilent Bob are a couple of faggots\n'cause of that all these dicks are\nwriting about the comic book Jay and\nSilent Bob! And maybe one night, me\nand Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,\nand she'll be like \"Oooo! I want to\nsuck youse guys dicks off. What's\nyour names?\"  And I'll be like, \"Jay\nand Silent Bob.\" And she'll be like,\n\"Oh--I read on the Internet that\nyouse guys were little fucking\njerkoffs.\"  And then she goes and\nsucks two other guys's dicks off\ninstead! Well fuck that!  We gotta\nput a stop to these hateful sonsa-\nbitches before they ruin our good\nnames!\n\nHOLDEN\nFirst off, I don't know how good\nyour names really are. Secondly,\nthere's not much you can do about\nstopping this bile. The Internet's\ngiven everyone in America a voice,\nand everyone in American has chosen\nto use that voice to bitch about\nmovies. As long as there's a Bluntman\nand Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are\ngonna have something negative to say\nabout it.  Jay steams, thinking.\nThen, a light dawns on him.\n\nJAY\nBut wait a second--if there wasn't a\nBluntman and Chronic movie, then no\none would be saying shit about Jay\nand Silent Bob, right?\n\nHOLDEN\nThey're not saying anything about\nyou now--they're talking about\nfictional characters!\n\nJAY\n(oblivious to Holden;\nto Bob)\nSo all we gotta do is stop 'em from\nmaking the movie!\n\nHOLDEN\nYeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in royalties\nyou're due in the process. Are you\nfucking retarded? Look, I'm probably\nnot alone in the opinion that this\nflick is the worst idea since Greedo\nshooting first. I mean, a Jay and\nSilent Bob movie? Who would pay to\nsee that?\n\nHolden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for\na beat. Then--\n\nHOLDEN\nBut since it is happening, you might\nas well just ignore the idiots on\nthe Internet, go find Banky, and get\nyour \"motherfucking movie check.\" As\nyou so succinctly put it. That's\nwhat's important here.\n\nJAY\nNo, Holden McNeil--what's important\nhere is that there's a bunch of\nmotherfuckers we don't even know\ncalling us assholes on the Internet\nto a bunch of teenagers and guys who\ncan't even get laid. Putting a stop\nto that is the most important thing\nwe could ever do.\n(off monitor)\nWhen did it say they're making that\nmovie?\n\nHOLDEN\nThey start this Friday.\n\nJAY\nSo if today's Tuesday, that gives us--\n(counts)\nEight days.\n\nHOLDEN\nIt's more like three days.\n\nJAY\nRight. Three days to stop that stupid\nfucking movie from getting made!\nC'mon, Silent Bob--\n\nJay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.\n\nJAY\nWe're going to Hollywood.\n\nThey stride off. Holden shakes his head.\n\nHOLDEN\nNow that's what I call the Blunt\nleading the Blunt.\n\nEXT. BUS STATION--DAY\n\nJay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled \"Los\nAngeles.\" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After\na beat, they re-emerge.\n\nJAY\nTickets? Since when did they start\ncharging for the bus?\n\nThey head toward the depot.\n\nJAY\nDidn't we used to ride that shit to\nschool every day for free?\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.\n\nINT. BUS--SAME\n\nJay makes his way up to the DRIVER.\n\nJAY\nWe in Hollywood yet?\n\nDRIVER\nIt's a three--day ride to Los Angeles,\nsir. We left twenty minutes ago.\n\nJAY\nI didn't ask you about Los Angeles.\nI asked you about Hollywood.\n\nDRIVER\nHollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.\n\nJAY\nDon't change the subject! Are we in\nHollywood yet or not?\n\nDRIVER\nPlease sit down, sir.\n\nJay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.\n\nJAY\nWhy don't you take your seat Ralph\nKramden--\n\nJay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nI'm fucking bored, man. There ain't\nshit to so on this bus.\n\nSilent Bob mimes jerking off.\n\nJAY\nI already did that. Twice.\n\nSilent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across\nthe aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld\nvideo game. He leans over to him.\n\nJAY\nYo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.\n\nCHILD\nLeave me alone, little kid.\n\nThe Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning\nto Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nThat fuck called me a little kid and\ngave me the finger! Go kick his ass!\n\nSilent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, \"He's\nten years old.\"\n\nJAY\nYou're my muscle, ain'tcha?\n\nSilent Bob kind of nods.\n\nJAY\nSo go open a can of whup-ass on that\nlittle fuck, and get me his game!\n\nSilent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the\naisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and\nregisters doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.\n\nSilent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches\nfor his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts\npunching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his\nseat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay\nlooks at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nYou're one tough motherfucker, you\nknow that?\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe bus pulls over by the side of the road.\n\nINT. BUS--DAY\n\nThe Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the\nbus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.\n\nPASSENGER\nThey been in there going on half an\nhour now! Two of them! Doing God\nknows what!\n\nThe Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.\n\nDRIVER\nThis bus isn't moving another inch\nunless you clear out of there right\nnow!\n\nNo answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.\n\nDRIVER\nDO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!\nNOW!!\n\nThe door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive\namounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the\nbus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed\ninto the bathroom, holding a massive joint.\n\nJAY\nUm--I think something's burning back\nhere.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--LATER\n\nAs the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left\nbehind.\n\nJAY\nThe whole fucking world's against\nus, dude. I swear to God.\n\nSilent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--LATER\n\nJay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.\n\nJAY\nThis sucks balls, man. How come we\nain't getting no rides?\n\nVOICE\n'Cause you're doing it all wrong.\n\nJay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.\n\nGUY\nYou gotta induce the drivers a little.\n\nJAY\nLike how?\n\nGUY\nLike this.\n\nThe GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head\nFor Ride.\n\nJAY\nYeah, but what happens when you get\nin the car, and you don't make with\nthe head? Don't they kick your ass\nto the curb?\n\nGUY\nSure--if you don't make with the\nhead.\n\nJay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--\n\nJAY\nEww! You eat the cock?!?\n\nGUY\nYeah. If it'll get me a few hundred\nmiles across country. I'll take a\nshot in the mouth.\n\nJAY\nYeah, but we ain't gay.\n\nGUY\nWell, neither am I. But have you\nseen the price of bus tickets lately?\nShit--I don't wanna cough up two\nhundred bucks just to get to Chicago.\n\nJAY\nWell, I don't wanna cough up some\ndude's sperm!\n\nGUY\nDon't be so suburban--this is the\nnew millennium. Gay, straight--it's\nall the same now. There're no more\nlines.\n\nJay draws a line on the ground with his foot.\n\nJAY\nThere's one. On this side of it, we\nain't gay.\n\nGUY\nAll hitchers do this. Why do you\nthink people pick us up? If you get\na ride, it's expected--I don't care\nwho the driver is. It's the first\nrule in the Book.\n\nJAY\nWhat book?\n\nGUY\nThe unwritten Book of the Road.\n\nA TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy\npoints to it, as if to say \"See?\" The passenger-side door\nopens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He\nlooks out the window at Jay and Bob.\n\nGUY\nFollow the rules of the Book, and\nyou'll get where you're going in no\ntime.  Excuse me.\n\nThrough the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go\nface-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers\nsmiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.\n\nJay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR\npulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window\nand leans toward them.\n\nNUN\nYou two boys need a ride?\n\nINT. CAR--LATER\n\nThe NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back\nseat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.\n\nNUN\nYou both don't have to sit back there.\nOne of you can sit up here with me.\n\nSilent Bob shakes his head \"no\" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs\nup front.\n\nNUN\nSo where are you boys from?\n\nJAY\nNew Jersey.\n\nNUN\nWhat brings you to Indiana?\n\nJAY\nWe're going to Hollywood.\n\nNUN\nHollywood, hunh? That's a long ways\naway.\n\nJAY\nYeah--we're lucky you picked us up.\n\nNUN\nWell, do unto others. That's what\nthe Book says.\n\nJAY\n(misinterpreting\ncompletely)\nWait a minute--you follow the Book,\ntoo?\n\nNUN\nI live my life by it.\n\nJAY\nReally? You?\n\nNUN\nOf course. You know how lonely it\ngets on the road? Thanks to the Book,\nI'm never alone--if you know what I\nmean.\n\nJAY\nI guess. This guy back there explained\nit to us. But I didn't think you'd\nbe into that.\n\nNUN\nAre you kidding? I've dedicated my\nlife to it. Every hour of every day.\n\nJAY\nShit--you nuns are alright.\n\nNUN\nYou live by the Book, too?\n\nJAY\nYou picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.\n\nNUN\nThat's good to hear. But it takes\ndeed, not words. It's a lot easier\nto say you live by the Book than to\nactually do it.\n(looks at him)\nCan you do it?\n\nJAY\nYou want me to do it right now?\n\nNUN\nNo time like the present, right?\n\nJay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head\n\"no.\" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and\nstarts to bend down.\n\nJAY\nAlright.\n(he suddenly stops)\nYou hear that? She's not a Catholic.\nShe's a Presbyterian.\n\nJay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE--DAY\n\nThe Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets\nkicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent\nBob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his\nmouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.\n\nJAY\nDude--she had seventies bush.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob continue hitching.\n\nJAY\nI can't believe this shit. Five hours\nand not a single ride. Every day,\nmillions of people hitch to Hollywood\nand stop studios from making movies\nabout 'em. But when you and me try\nit, it's like we're trapped in a\nfucking cartoon!\n\nA familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the\nraid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,\nand race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.\n\nINT. VAN--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--\n\nA clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed\nBeauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.\n\nJay looks at Silent Bob.\n\nJAY\nZoinks, yo\n\nGUY\nAnd now we can finally solve the\nmystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!\nPull off their masks and let's see\nwho they really are!\n\nBOOKISH\nI don't think they are masks.\n\nBEAUTY\nI don't think they're Hitchhiking\nGirls either.\n\nBOOKISH\nGhouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.\n(to herself)\nThough I wish they were hitchhiking\ngirls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking\ngirls--\n\nGUY\nLet's kick them out. We've got a\nmystery to solve.\n\nDUDE\nThe only mystery here is why we take\nour cues from a dick in a neckerchief!\n\nGUY\nKeep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you\nto the fucking dog!\n\nBEAUTY\n(covering her ears;\nshrieking)\nI CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!\n\nJAY\nYO!\n\nThe Gang look to Jay and Bob.\n\nJAY\nYouse guys need to turn those frowns\nupside down! And we got just the\nthing for that.\n(pulls out a bag of\njoints)\nWe call them Doobie Snax.\n\nINT. VAN--WEED VISION\n\nAs Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky\n(with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze,\nwe see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling\nabout their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken\noff to reveal a man inside a costume.\n\nJay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint\nand look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total\ndebauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy\ncackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish\nand Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.\nThe Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--\n\nGREAT DANE\nRi, Ray rand Rirent Rob\n\nThe Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking\nway out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-\neyed.\n\nJAY\nLook at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's\ngot a stoner-boner!!!\n\nJay and Bob smile and pass out.\n\nWe cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to\nWeed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.\n\nBEAUTY\nI think they passed out.\n\nGUY\nGreat. What do we do with them now?\n\nDUDE\nLet's cut out their kidneys to sell\non the black market and leave them\nin a seedy motel bathtub full of\nice.\n\nBOOKISH\nOh God, not again?\n\nINT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT\n\nJay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar\non his back.\n\nEXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY\n\nJay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as\nwell, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see\nthe scar. It's not there.\n\nJAY\nHoly shit, I had a horrible dream.\n(looks around)\nYo, I'm hungry. Where can we get\nsome breakfast?\n\nBob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,\nand Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.\n\nEXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY\n\nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob\nenter.\n\nINT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME\n\nAs the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public\nINTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.\n\nJAY\nYo--check that shit out: the Internet.\nLet's see if those fucks said\nsomething new about us and that stupid\nflick.\n\nBob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar\nand types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look\nat the screen and go wide-eyed.\n\nJAY\n\"Any movie based on Jay and Silent\nBob is gonna lick balls, because\nthey both, in fact, lick balls. Namely\neach other's.\"\n\nJay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.\n\nJAY\nEww.\n(reading further)\n\"Yes--they are real people. Real\nstupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.\"\n(to Bob)\nMotherfucker! It's time we wrote\nsomething back! Type this shit down.\n\nSilent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.\n\nJAY\nAll you motherfuckers are gonna pay.\nYou are the ones who are the ball-\nlickers.  We're gonna fuck your\nmothers whole you watch and cry like\nlittle bitches. Once we get to\nHollywood and find those Miramax\nfucks who are making the movie, we're\ngonna make 'em eat our shit, then\nshit our shit, then eat their shit\nwhich is made of our shit that we\nmade 'em eat. Then all you\nmotherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay\nand Silent Bob.\n\nSilent Bob finishes typing and presses \"Return\". He and Jay\nnod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking\nup at the menu board.\n\nJAY\nThat'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat\nour Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get\nback on the road, get to Hollywood,\nand stop that fucking movie from\ngetting made. No more hairy-bush\nnuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye\non the prize, and not let nothing--\nand I mean NOTHING--distract me.\n\nAs Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and\nfreezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all\nin SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in\nthe World. She's bathed in light, glowing.\n\nShe bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.\n\nJay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then\nat the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's\neyes, getting zero response.\n\nJAY'S POV\n\nThe Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to\nher breasts, then down to her crotch.\n\nJay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle\nof the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss\non her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager\nto get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous\nwith the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.\n\nBut it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to\nSilent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls\nhis eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it\nover Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She\nsmiles at the zombified Jay.\n\nGIRL\n(off cup)\nOh my God. Do you get free refills\nwith that?\n\nJAY\nOh, what--this? I just wear this for\nprotection. You know--so no guys try\nto grab my shit.\n\nGIRL\nHi. I'm Justice.\n\nJAY\n(dreamily)\nAnd I am so fucking yours--\n\nSilent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.\n\nJAY\nI mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my\nhereto life-mate, Silent Bob.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\nJAY\nJustice, hunh? That's a nice name.\n(under his breath, to\nBob)\nJay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-\nU-C-K-I-N-G--\n(back to Justice)\nSo you come here often?\n\nJUSTICE\nOh, I'm not from around here. My\nfriends and I are taking a road trip,\nand we just stopped to grab something\nto eat.\n\nJAY\nYour friends, hunh? Where they at?\n\nJUSTICE\n(pointing)\nOut there. By that van.\n\nJay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other\ngorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair\naround, looking incredibly sexy.\n\nWithout looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--\n\nJAY\nDude--I think I just filled the cup.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nJay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the\nother Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food\nto her friends.\n\nJAY\nLadies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent\nBob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!\n\nSISSY\nWho the fuck are these guys?\n\nJUSTICE\nThis is Jay and Silent Bob.\n(to Jay and Bob)\nGuys, this is Sissy, Missy, and\nChrissy.\n\nCHRISSY\nWhere the fuck did they come from?\n\nJUSTICE\nI met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch\na ride.\n\nSISSY\nI don't know if that's such a great\nidea. Jussy.\n\nJAY\nSure it is, Juggs.\n\nMISSY\nOh my god--he just called Sissy\n\"Juggs\"!\n\nCHRISSY\nI'm on it.\n\nChrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.\n\nJUSTICE\nChrissy, no!\n\nSissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.\n\nSISSY\nWe're in the middle of suburbia,\nChrissy. Let's try to act like it.\n\nCHRISSY\n\n}\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nAnd what-stupid ass little foul-\nmouthed bitch-boys don't get their\nballs cut off in suburbia?\n\nJAY\n(oblivious)\nWhat's with the knife? We having\ncake or something?\n\nCHRISSY\nHoly shit--he's retarded, to boot.\n\nJAY\n(to Silent Bob)\nYo--she called you retarded.\n\nSISSY\n(to Justice)\nWhat's wrong with you, Justice? You\ndo remember where we're going, don't\nyou?\n\nMISSY\nThat we do have a job to do?\n\nJUSTICE\nThey're just gonna tag along for a\nfew miles. They won't get in the\nway, I promise.\n(cutesy)\nPlease?\n\nSISSY\nFine--they can ride with us. But\nthey're so out of here before we get\nto Boulder.\n\nJUSTICE\nHonest Injun.\n\nCHRISSY\n\"Honest Injun\"?\n(to Sissy)\nI can't believe what a pushover you\nare.\n\nJAY\nAnd I can't believe fine-ass bitches\nlike yourselves eat that shit. Don't\nyou know fast food makes girls fart?\n\nSuddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting\ninto the van.\n\nBRENT\nSay--what's all this talk about\nfarting?\n\nSissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to\nsweet and airy, totally switching characters.\n\nSISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY\nHi Brent!\n\nSISSY\nThis is Brent. He's with us, too.\n\nCHRISSY\nBrent, tell these sillies that girls\ndon't fart.\n\nBRENT\nOf course they don't! Only skeevy\nstoners fart.\n\nThe very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay\nand Silent Bob.\n\nBRENT\nWhat up, homies?\n(off the Girls)\nWow, Three guys, four girls--\n(to Jay and Bob)\nWhat's the count boys?\n\nJay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.\n\nINT. VAN--DAY\n\nBrent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and\nBob listen, rolling eyes.\n\nBRENT\nHey there mister science-guy. Don't\nspray that aerosol in my eye. For I\ndon't really want to die. I'm a noble\nrabbit!\n\nJAY\nWhat're you guys, like a cover band\nor something?\n\nSISSY\nWe're the Kansas State chapter of\nS.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal\nCruelty.\n\nCHRISSY\nAnd we're on our way to Colorado to\ngive Provasik a piece of our minds!\n\nEveryone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you bitches babbling\nabout?\n\nBRENT\nHey! Watch the language little boy.\nThere are females present.\n\nJay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts\nthem.\n\nJUSTICE\nProvasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical\nlab where they perform gross\nexperiments on animals.\n\nJAY\nSo, what kind of animals are we\ntalking about here--like bears and\nrhinos?\n\nBRENT\nNo--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...\nheck, even monkeys, If we don't speak\nfor them, who will?\n(touches Justice's\narm)\nRight, Jussy?\n\nJay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After\na beat, he relaxes.\n\nJAY\nHey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you\nover here for a second?\n\nBrent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him\nconfidentially.\n\nJAY\nBe honest, yo--you're down with this\nfor the fine-ass pussy, right?\n\nBRENT\nI'm down with this because I love\nanimals, stupid.\n\nJAY\nEven sheep?\n\nBRENT\nOf course.

You've\ngot a sick and twisted world\nperspective.\n\nJAY\nNo, you misunderstand me, Prince\nValiant. I mean if you were another\nsheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if\nyou were another sheep?\n\nBRENT\nI--suppose so.\n\nJAY\nThat's what I thought.\n(suddenly loudly, to\nall)\nYO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF\nUS! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY\n\nThe side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled\nout of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as\nwell, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.\n\nJAY\nYA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY--LATER\n\nThe van drives down the road.\n\nINT. VAN--SAME\n\nMissy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels\nbetween them.\n\nCHRISSY\nWhat the fuck are we gonna do now?\n\nSISSY\nShut up, I'm thinking.\n\nIn the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her,\nand she quickly folds them up.\n\nJAY\nIs Hollywood near where we're going?\n\nJUSTICE\nIs that where you guys are from?\n\nJAY\nCh'yeah, right. Jersey represent!\n\nJUSTICE\nOh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you\nall the way out here?\n\nJAY\nWell, we couldn't hang in front of\nthe Quick Stop no more, 'cause of\nthe strainen-en order, which sucks\nass 'cause it's been like our home\nsince we were kids. Silent Bob even\nbusted his cherry there.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Bob)\nYou did? I'll bet she was a lucky\ngirl.\n\nBob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has\nstrayed.\n\nJAY\nLook, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying\nto tell a story here.\n\nJUSTICE\nSorry.\n\nJAY\nAnyway, we were talking to Brodie\nand he said there's gonna be a\nBluntman and Chronic movie. So we\nwent to see Holden McNeil, and he\nshowed us the Internet, and that's\nwhere we found all these fucking\nlittle jerkoffs were saying shit\nabout us. So we decided to go to\nHollywood and stop the movie from\ngetting made.  And now we're here.\n\nJUSTICE\nWow. I have no idea what you just\nsaid.\n\nJAY\nYeah, I get that a lot. So you like\nanimals, huh?\n\nJUSTICE\nSure.\n\nJAY\nThat's cool. Even snakes?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou can't exclude an animal just\nbecause it's not cuddly. Of course I\nlike snakes.\n\nJAY\nHow about trouser snakes?\n\nJUSTICE\nWhat's a trouser snake?\n\nJust then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.\n\nJAY DEVIL\n(to Jay)\nWhat the fuck are you waiting for?\nShe went for the setup! Reach in\nyour fucking pants, and pull yer\ncock out, bitch! That's the kinda\nshit girls like!\n\nSuddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right\nshoulder.\n\nJAY DEVIL 2\nRight about here's where the angel's\nsupposed to show up and tell you not\nto pull your dick out. But we bitch-\nslapped that little fuck and sent\nhim packing, so it's smooth sailing.\nLet 'er rip, boy!\n\nThey disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his\nhand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick,\nwhen suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder,\nrubbing a swollen jaw.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nSorry I'm late. So what's the deal\nhere?\n(looks down)\nOh, shit--you're not thinking of\nwhipping your dick out at this fine\npiece of woman, are you?\n\nJay thinks, then nods \"Yes.\" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes,\nand slaps him.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nTell you what: look at Silent Bob.\nSee if he thinks it's a good idea to\nwhip your dick out.\n\nJay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in\nhis pants to Jay and shakes his head \"no,\" sternly. Jay\nwithdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods,\nsatisfied.\n\nJAY ANGEL\nThat's it, boy--put the dick down.\nYou gotta go from the heart, yo. No\nlittle perv bullshit will do for\nthis one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de\nla Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the\nshit out of two suckerpunching little\nbitches. Remember--don't pull your\ndick out until she asks you to.\n(beat)\nOr until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!\nThe Jay Angel blinks away. Justice\nlooks at Jay, a bit confused.\n\nJAY\nDon't ask.\n(beat)\nSo, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like\nme do to help the animals?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou really don't want to help us--\n\nJAY\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\nSure I do. I'd do anything for you.\n\nJustice smiles. Jay tries to recover.\n\nJAY\nI mean, youse guys! I'd do anything\nfor youse guys. For the lift and\nshit.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou sure?\n\nJAY\nSure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.\nFuck\n\nJUSTICE\nWell--okay. Let me talk it over with\nthe other girls and get back to you.\n\nJAY\nYou do that.\n\nJay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.\n\nJAY\nI'll be right here.\n\nHe winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the\ncan, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and\nwinking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly,\nthen imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.\n\nJAY\nFuck you. Fatty.\n\nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY\n\nThe van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls\nhead toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent\nBob.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou guys want anything from inside?\n\nJAY\nNo, we're cool, thanks hon.\n\nJustice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study\nthe front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a\nplace to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.\nAfter a beat--\n\nJAY\nIt just ain't the same, is it? This\nplace licks balls compared to Quick\nStop.\n\nSilent Bob shakes his head \"Yeah.\"\n\nJAY\nAnd speaking of licking balls--how\n'bout that Justice chick? She is too\nfine.  And she smells so fucking\npretty. She's got a nice voice, too.\nAnd that body?  Smoking. You know,\nshe never once said \"fuck off,\" when\nI was talking to her, or pulled out\nthe pepper spray, or nothing. I tell\nya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.\n\nINT.

He was our\npatsy!\n\nJUSTICE\nWe'll find someone else. Besides, I\ndidn't see you trying to stop Jay\nfrom throwing him out.\n\nSISSY\nBecause I didn't want to blow our\ncover!\n\nJUSTICE\nCover, shmover--you all hated his\nsongs, too.\n\nCHRISSY\nNot as much as I hate you.\n\nJustice offers Chrissy a cold glance,\n\nCHRISSY\nFuck, if I don't get to kill someone\nsoon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!\n\nSISSY\n(rubbing Chrissy's\nshoulders)\nDon't mind Chrissy. She's just a\nlittle too wound for sound.\n\nCHRISSY\nThen how about you help me take the\nedge off?\n\nChrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot\nand heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other\ncustomers regard them wide-eyed.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Customers)\nThey're really good friends.\n\nSISSY\n(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)\nWould you two knock it off? We're in\nthe fucking heartland here! Try to\nblend!\n\nJUSTICE\nThey already do--she's the milkmaid,\nand she's the cow.\n\nCHRISSY\nOh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,\nbitch. And now I'm gonna rip your\nhead off and fuck your spine stump.\n\nSISSY\nEnough!\n(calm to Justice)\nWe have a very simple gang here,\nJustice.

I'm\ngonna take Missy into the dirty\nconvenience store bathroom and hate-\nfuck the shit out of her.\n\nChrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.\n\nJUSTICE\nAnd you said letting them read all\nthat Anais Nin wouldn't amount to\nanything.\n\nSISSY\nDon't change the subject. You know\nwhat you have to do now, right? Since\nyou let our patsy slip away, you've\ngotta convince the little kid and\nthat fat guy to take his place.\nThey've gotta break into Provasik\nnow.\n\nJUSTICE\nUh-uh!\n\nSISSY\nUh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out\nof this gang. Just use the little\none's crush to convince him, since\nhe's so fucking in love with you.\n\nJUSTICE\nJay? No he's not.\n\nSISSY\nWhat--am I blind?

PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT\n\nJay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,\nstopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN\nout of his coat.

Justice offers\nSissy a look.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou are so gay.\n\nChrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a\ndigital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four\ndifferent digits. The door lock CLICKS open.\n\nSISSY\nOnce we're inside, I want complete\nsilence.\n(holding up high-tech\ndevice)\nMissy whipped this up. It counts our\ndecibel level. If it goes into the\nred--alarm, we're dead. So not even\nthe slightest noise, got it?\n\nJustice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed\nclosely by Chrissy.

PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.\n\nIt's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking\nANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his\neyes and hits him.\n\nJAY\nStay frosty, you big fucking softie.\nWe've got a job to do.\n\nSilent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade\nthrough the cages.

At the\nother end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.\n\nSissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays\nthe air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor,\nwhich rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly,\nwithin the mist, laser beams become apparent.\n\nSissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few\nsteps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs\nforward and does an impressive series of flips down the\nhallway, not touching a single laser beam.\n\nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\nOnce Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of\nthe hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture\nto Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series\nof flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.\n\nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.\n\nJustice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to\nChrissy.\n\nChrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,\nSissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.\n\nThen, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are\neven more impressive than the other two, including running\nup walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes\nthe last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice,\narms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud,\nmanly FART.\n\nThe decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING\nthrough the building.\n\nCHRISSY\nHoly fuck--the little stoner was\nright--\n\nSissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds.

PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT\n\nJay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something\nseems to move inside it.

Now\nwe got what we came for, so let's\nget the fuck out!\n\nSilent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes\nhis head frustrated.\n\nJAY\nYeah, it's sad!

BEFORE THIS THING TURNS\nEXPLOSIVE!\n\nThe counter on the device attached to the van hits \"0,\" and\nthe van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one\ndirection, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks\nat the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.\n\nJAY\nJustice--\n\nWe crane up from him as he bellows--\n\nJAY\nJUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!\n\nSilent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still\ncarrying the bag.\n\nEXT.

This\ninvestigation is now under my\njurisdiction.\n\nCOP 1\nOh really? And why is that?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nBecause someone let a whole mess of\nanimals out of their cages, sir.\n\nCOP 1\nWell, we believe that was just a\ndiversionary tactic used to call\nattention away from the real heist\nover here at the Diamond Exchange.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYeah, right. That's a believable\nscenario. It sounds more like\nsomething out of a bad movie.\n\nWillenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another\nCOP joins them.\n\nCOP 2\nSir, the Provasik people say they've\nrounded all their animals up, except\nfor one: an orangutan.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nListen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our\nfugitive has been on the run for 6\nhours!  Average simian foot speed\nover uneven ground--barring injuries\nor preoccupation with tire tubes,\nmites or bananas--is four miles an\nhour. That gives us a radius of twenty\nmiles.\n\nCOP 3\n(calling out from\ncrowd)\nTwenty-four, sir!\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat?\n\nCOP 3\nSix hours times four miles an hour\nis twenty-four.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(doing the math in\nhis head)\nYes.

What's a \"hard\ntarget\"?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWell. It's--a target--that's--hard.\nAnyway--\n\nCOP 4\nSo are you referring to the search's\nlevel of difficulty? Or is the hard\ntarget the monkey?\n\nCOP 3\nOr the people who stole the monkey?\n\nThe COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of\n\"Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,\"etc.\nWillenholly rubs his temples.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOkay, how about this? What I want\nout of all of you is a thorough search\nof every gas station, residence,\nwarehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,\nouthouse, and doghouse in that area!\nCheckpoints go up at fifteen miles!\n\nCOP 1\nWouldn't it make sense to put them\nup at every twenty-four miles--seeing\nas that's how far they'd have gotten\nin the last six hours?\n\nThey begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly\nlooks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nThis is so frustrating. It's just so\nhard sometimes--\n(yelling)\nYOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO\nFIND HER!\n\nAnother COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.\n\nCOP 5\nSir, this was just delivered to the\nstation.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat is it?\n\nCOP 5\nIt's a tape from the terrorists who're\nclaiming credit for the break-in.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nIs it VHS or Beta?

We're all over the C.L.I.T.,\nReg.\n\nHOLDEN\n(shakes his head)\nNights like this, I miss dating a\nlesbian.\n\nINT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT\n\nFrom behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV,\nslack-jawed.\n\nANCHORMAN (O.S.)\n(from TV)\nIs there also speculation that Jay\nand Silent bob may be responsible\nfor the Diamond Exchange jewel heist\nthat occurred in the same vicinity\nof downtown Boulder last night?\n\nWILLENHOLLY (O.S.)\nThere's nothing to suggest that, no.\nBut these men are still to be\nconsidered very dangerous.\n\nRANDAL\n(to Dante)\nI told you that restraining order\nwas a good idea.\n\nEXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME\n\nOn the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel,\nSissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink\nchampagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans\nagainst the open sliding glass door, watching the news report\non a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.\n\nANCHORMAN\n(on TV)\nIs that your cell phone?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(on TV)\nYes, Excuse me.\n(on TV, into cell\nphone)\nFederal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my\nway!\n(shuts phone; to\nanchorman)\nWe got 'em. They're in Utah.\n(to camera)\nCitizens of Utah--steer clear of the\nC.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T.\nis not recommended.\n\nJustice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.\n\nJUSTICE\nYour tape worked. The news is all\nabout Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik\nbreak-in, with almost no mention of\nthe Diamond heist.\n\nSISSY\n(yelling down to\nJustice)\nI told you those two were the perfect\npatsies. Now we lay low for awhile--\njust in case--and start planning the\nnext job.\n\nJUSTICE\nDon't you feel any regret? Jay and\nBob don't deserve this. They were\nreally sweet.\n\nCHRISSY\nThe only thing I regret is not gutting\nthat little trout-mouthed prick like\na fish and playing Twister with his\nvitals.\n\nMISSY\nYou are so nasty.\n\nCHRISSY\nI'll show you nasty, you little slut.\n\nSISSY\nWould you two get a room?\n\nCHRISSY\nFine--we'll take yours.\n(getting up in Sissy's\nface)\nI am gonna stain your sheets, bi-\notch.\n\nChrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls\nher eyes.\n\nSISSY\nSarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.\n\nJUSTICE\nThey're your gang.\n\nSISSY\nOh and not yours? You know, I don't\nget you, Justice. You used to be all\nabout the girl stuff: stealing,\nboning, blowing shit up. Now you're\nlike this little priss with a\nconscience. It's really a fucking\ndrag.\n\nJUSTICE\nWe all gotta grow up some time.\n\nSISSY\nIf moping around over some little\nboy you're crushing on is being grown-\nup, then pass me my Wonder Woman\nunderoos.\n\nJUSTICE\nDon't you feel the least bit of guilt\nfor what we did to those guys?\n\nSISSY\nAwww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty\nabout setting up her boyfriend? Then\nhow about taking a shower?\n\nSissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace.\nThey rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY\nGUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.\n\nPIZZA DELIVERY GUY\nYou the gals that ordered the pizzas?\n\nSISSY\nThis dopey bitch ordered the large\nplain, but I could go for some hot,\nthick, Sicilian.\n\nPIZZA DELIVERY GUY\nNo charge, lady.  He rushes into the\nmotel, Justice sighs, looking up at\nthe stars.\n\nJUSTICE\n(quietly)\nI'm sorry, Jay.\n\nINT. DINER--DAY\n\nJay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay\nchews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne\ndigs into a banana split.\n\nJAY\nYou know, Justice died trying to\nsave this monkey, so maybe we should\nkeep her around. That way, we can\nhonor her memory.\n\nSilent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their\nfood.\n\nJAY\nLook at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing\nall sentimental, and you're all about\na fucking meal and shit. Now ain't\nyou glad we stopped to eat?  And you\nwere all piss-scared the cops'd bust\nus or something. You know what I\nsay?\n(singing, a la NWA)\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\n(via bullhorn)\nTHIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE!

It's not a monkey.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nLook, who's the Federal Wildlife\nMarshal here?\n(into bullhorn)\nJAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL\nWILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR\nC.L.I.T.

I said that shit before\nI knew they were gonna shoot us!\nYes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't\ntakin' no bullet for no monkey!\n\nBob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay\nrolls his eyes.\n\nJAY\nOh, brother--this is like something\nout of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe\nit's not that bad back at the lab!\nMaybe they experiment on 'em by,\nlike making 'em fuck a bunch of\ndifferent, good-looking monkeys. We\ndon't know! Maybe they got it real\nsweet!\n\nSuzanne shakes her head \"no.\" Bob points to her, as if she's\nstrengthening his point.\n\nJAY\n(to Suzanne)\nYou stay out of this, you weepy little\nchimp!\n(looks around thinking)\nFuck man, I ain't no strategist!\nYou're the guy that makes the\nblueprints! I don't even have the\nfucking smarts of a little--\n\nJay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's\na little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded\nsweatshirt and a baseball cap.\n\nJAY\n--kid\n\nEXT. DINER--DAY\n\nWillenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The\nSheriff looks on.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY\nBETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO\nOPEN FIRE!\n(to cops)\nEveryone has bullets in their guns,\nright?\n\nJay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between\nthem (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed\nup in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the\ndiner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.\nIt's a pretty piss-poor disguise.\n\nJAY\nDon't shoot! We're just trying to\ntake our son out of this hostile\nenvironment!\n\nFrom behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.\n\nSHERIFF\nTheir \"son\"?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nMaybe they're one of those gay\ncouples?\n\nJay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.\n\nJAY\nYeah! We're gay! And this is our\nadopted love child! We're not from\naround here!  Don't make us go back\nto our liberal city home with a tales\nof prejudice and bigotry in the heart\nof Utah!\n(whispers to Bob)\nYou see the shit I gotta put up with\nfor you! Now I got this guy thinking\nI'm gay!\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOh God, this is the last thing I\nneed--a bunch of uppity homosexuals\nshooting their mouth off in the\nliberal press that the Federal\nWildlife Marshal's Office persecutes\ngays.\n\nSHERIFF\nARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY\nBE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON!\nTHAT'S THE APE!\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYou see this badge?  I think I'd\nrecognize an ape if I saw one. And\nthe only thing I do recognize here\nis a political fiasco I'm, going to\navoid by letting this butt-fucking\nBrady Bunch go!\n\nJay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--\n\nJAY\nAnd I'll tell you another thing:\nwhat if that guy shows up around the\nstores one day and starts telling\neverybody you and me are poo-gilists?\nHow are we gonna get any pussy then,\nhunh?\n\nWILLENHOLLY (V.O.)\nYOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!\n\nJay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look\nback out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at\nhimself, as if to say, \"Me?\"\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(via bullhorn)\nYES, YOU, SIRS.\n\nJAY\n(calling over)\nSo we can just go?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(via bullhorn)\nYes, sir--or ma'am.

We'll tell all our gay\nfriends that Utah is Gay friendly\ncountry for gays who are gay.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nI'm sure Utah appreciates that. You\nmight also want to make it clear\nthat the Federal Wildlife Marshal's\nOffice is also pro-'mo as well.\n(winks at the sheriff)\nAnd might I add, that's one fine-\nlooking boy you're raising.\n\nJAY\nWell, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm.\nSee, I knocked up a hot woman friend\nof ours who I also fuck on the side.\nSo as not to be all-the-way-gay. But\nmy tubby husband here is one hundred\npercent queer. He loves the cock.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nHe certainly looks insatiable.\n\nJAY\n'Bye\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n'Bye\n\nJay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road.\nWillenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWell, it's not my way--but damned if\nthere doesn't go one happy family.\n(balloon two)\nNow, we just shoot some tear gas\ninto that diner, and when the two\nguys run out with the monkey, we'll--\n\nWillenholly suddenly freezes, thinking.

You make up some shit,\nfight him for a while, I film it, I\nyell \"cut,\" and then head back to my\ntrailer, where I got more white women\nwaiting for me there than the first\nlifeboat off the Titanic!\n(confidentially)\nThey all want a part of the movie,\nand I got just the part for 'em.\n\nJay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.\n\nCHAKA\nLET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!\n\nA.D. (O.S.)\nQUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!\n\nChaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him\nwith another cup of coffee.\n\nP.A.\nI got you another cup of coffee,\nsir. Spit free.\n\nChaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.\n\nThe Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and\nBob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.\n\nCLAPPER/LOADER\nI just wanna say that I loved when\nyou fucked that pie.\n(calling off)\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,\nSCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!\n\nThe clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From\nbehind the monitor,\n\nChaka calls out--\n\nCHAKA\nACTION!\n\nJay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for\na beat. Then--\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nUh--Snootchie Bootchies.\n\nSuddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit\nthe deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the\narch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking\nman with huge, overgrown FISTS.\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nWhat the fuck?\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\nYou thought I'd never find your\nprecious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp\nKnight? But now you and your sidekick\nare finally in the grasp of Cock-\nKnocker!\n\nJAY/CHRONIC\nWhy do they call you \"Cock-Knocker\"?\n\nCock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls.\nJay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a\nvibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button\non it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a\nlight saber.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\nAny last words before I bust your\nballs, Bluntman?\n\nSilent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--\n\nA wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the\nplacard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.\nIt's out of his reach.\n\nSilent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his\nhand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.\n\nSuddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.\nThe Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive\npose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair\nstart light saber dueling.\n\nCHAKA\n(from behind monitor)\nDamn! Now that was one special effect!\nThis picture's gonna make House Party\nlook like House Party Two!\n\nA.D.\nOr House Party Three?\n\nCHAKA\nShut the fuck up!\n\nCock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive\nblade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the\nladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He\nlands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-\nKnocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on\nhis ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver\na saber kill-shot, when we hear--\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nYO-BITCH-FISTS!\n\nCock-Knocker turns to see--\n\nJay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a\ndouble-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la\nthe Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).\n\nJAY\nCall me Darth Balls. Bunngg.\n\nJay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong\nSaber.\n\nCHAKA\n(from behind the\nmonitor)\nI think George Lucas is going to sue\nsomebody--\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nWillenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a\nshotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside\nthe flashing red light.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(looking around)\nSo, this is Hollywood?\n(suddenly full of\npurpose)\nLights, camera, action, Jay and Silent\nBob.\n\nWillenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY\n\nThe door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two\nshots, O.C.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nFREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!\n\nWillenholly goes wide-eyed.\n\nIt's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a\nkid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a\nBarney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare\nback at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking\nbullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nOh my God--\n(to kids)\nUm--sorry. That was supposed to be a\nwarning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm\non the wrong, uh--wrong set.\n\nThe Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the\nO.C. Willenholly.\n\nKID\nYou killed Mooby--\n(to Kids)\nLET'S GET HIM!!!\n\nThe Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as\nhe's attacked.\n\nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME\n\nJay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\n(breaking character)\nYou are not upstaging me, Van Der\nBeek!\n\nJay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker,\nhacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear\nreactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade\nthe attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other\nhand.\n\nCOCK-KNOCKER\n(to O.C. Chaka)\nCHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A\n\"CUT\"!\n\nOn cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's\nhuge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).\n\nSilent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber,\nJay grins at Cock-Knocker.\n\nJAY\nNow whose balls have been busted,\nbitch?\n\nSuddenly, a gun shot rings out.\n\nAll turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun\nfirst on Jay, then Bob.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nThe C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and\nSilent Bob!\n(revealing badge:\ncalling out)\nEveryone stay calm. I'm a Federal\nWildlife Marshal. These men are the\nleaders of a terrorist organization\nwanted for the abduction of a monkey.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nThey didn't really steal that monkey.\n\nAll turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows.\nWillenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.\n\nJUSTICE\nIt was just a diversion so we could\nsteal these.\n\nJustice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing\nthem.\n\nJUSTICE\nAnd they're not the leaders of\nC.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nNo--the clit's real. The female orgasm\nis a myth.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Jay)\nAre you guys alright?\n\nJAY\nI thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty\nFuck.\n\nJUSTICE\n(smiling)\nYou remembered.\n(back to business)\nIt was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,\nChrissy, and I are international\njewel thieves. We were setting you\nup as a patsy, but I couldn't go\nthrough with it, because I... because\nI love you.\n\nJAY\nYeah? So that means you'll fuck me,\nright?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nIf she does, it'll be considered\nnecrophilia.\n\nAll turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the\nshadows, guns drawn.\n\nSISSY\nBecause she's gonna be one dead bitch.\n(to Justice)\nHi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad\ntime?\n\nMISSY\nYou should've just let these guys go\ndown, Jussy.\n\nJAY\nHey, I wanted to go down, but I was\nwaiting until I got to know her a\nlittle better. See, there was this\nlittle angel on my shoulder, and he\nsaid--\n\nCHRISSY\nShut the fuck up before I shoot you\nwhere you stand in your pansy red\nbooties.\n\nJAY\n(looking down)\nHoly shit, I am wearing pansy red\nbooties!\n(to Bob)\nMan--why the fuck didn't you tell\nme?\n\nSISSY\nLet's have those diamonds, Jussy.\n\nJUSTICE\nI can't do that, Sissy\n\nSISSY\n(points her gun at\nJay)\nThen lover--boy gets one in the brain.\n\nCHAKA\nYO!\n\nAll turn to look at Chaka.\n\nCHAKA\nWould any of you lovely ladies like\na private audition to be in my movie?\n\nJustice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on\nthe ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and\nrunning for cover.\n\nJay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.\n\nMissy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed\ncraft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start\nfiring at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren\ncraft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented\ncan of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are\nout of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and\nreload. From behind his table,\n\nWillenholly yells--\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M\nJUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!\n\nCHRISSY\nTWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,\nTALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!\n\nMISSY\nAND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!\n\nThe Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire\nagain.\n\nChaka ducks behind the monitor.\n\nCHAKA\nA shitload of white people with guns?\nTime to get my black ass out of here!\n\nHe races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each\nother defensively, striking kung fu poses.\n\nSISSY\nYou really let me down, Justice.\nThrowing it all away for a little\nstoner with bad pronunciation.\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nHEY!\n\nJUSTICE\n(ignoring him)\nWhat's it gonna be, Sissy? Which\nfighting style do you want me to\nkick your ass in?\n\nSISSY\nAre you kidding me? I taught you all\nall your moves myself. There's not a\nstyle you can bust that I can't defend\nagainst.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou're no match for my \"Shaolin Monk.\"\n\nSISSY\nYeah, but I can bury you with my\n\"Crouching Tiger.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nA little \"Venus's--flytrap\"?\n\nSISSY\nI'll counter with \"Dragon Crane.\"\n\nJUSTICE\nHow about a little \"Bitch, My Man\nAin't Yo Baby's Daddy\"?\n\nSISSY\n(beat; smiles)\nBring it on.\n\nJustice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch\ninto a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and\nscreaming.\n\nBehind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.\n\nJAY\nYo--I hope one of 'em rips the other\none's shirt off and we see some tit.\n\nBoth Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins\nthem, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.\n\nBANKY\nMister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I\njust wanted to say hi. I'm--\n\nJAY\nBanky fucking Edwards! Just the\nmotherfucker we came to see!\n\nBANKY\n(shocked)\nHoly shit! What the fuck are you\nguys doing here?!\n\nSissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the\nfloor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.\n\nBANKY\nStop the movie?! Are you crazy?!\n\nJAY\nAll these assholes are calling us\nnames on the Internet, 'cause of\nthis stupid movie!\n\nBANKY\nI feel for you boys--I really do.\nThose Net snipers can be really cruel.\nBut Miramax paid me a shitload of\nmoney for Bluntman and Chronic, so\nit occurs to me that people bad-\nmouthing you on some web-site is\nnone of my FUCKING CONCERN!\n\nSILENT BOB\nOh--but I think it is.\n\nBanky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.\n\nJAY\nHere we go again--\n\nSILENT BOB\nShut the fuck up.\n(to Banky)\nWe had a deal with you on the comics\nfor likeness rights. And as we're\nnot only the artistic basis but also\nthe character basis for your\nintellectual property, Bluntman and\nChronic, when we said property was\noptioned by Miramax Films you were\nlegally obliged to secure our\npermission to transfer the concept\nto another medium. As you failed to\ndo that, you're in breach of the\noriginal contract--ergo, you find\nyourself in a very actionable\nposition.\n\nBanky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a\nbeat, Jay adds--\n\nJAY\nYeah.\n\nJustice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head\nand kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.\n\nBANKY\nSo, what do you guys want, to go\naway and take your lady friends with\nyou?\n\nJAY\nShitcan this movie so we don't get\ncalled names on the Internet anymore.\n\nBANKY\nEven if there's no movie, people are\nstill free to talk shit about you on\nthe Internet. That's what the\nInternet's for: slandering others\nanonymously.  Stopping the flick\nisn't going to stop that!\n\nIn the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the\nair.\n\nJAY\nWell this isn't fair!  We went to\nHollywood, I fell in love, we stole\na monkey, we got shot at, and got\npunched in the motherfucking nuts!\nWe ain't leaving empty-handed!\n\nOn cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.\n\nJAY\nWhat's up baby? You look good!\n\nBANKY\nIsn't that your girlfriend's enemy?\n\nJAY\nOh yeah.\n(pushing Sissy off\nhim)\nGet the fuck offa me, pig!\n\nSissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.\n\nJay, Bob, and Banky continue.\n\nBANKY\nYou guys are gonna ruin my movie\ncareer.\n\nJAY\nWell, we want something for our mental\nanguish.\n\nBANKY\nTell you what: we'll settle this\nmonetarily. I'll give you half of\nwhat I made.\n\nJAY\nHalf?!?\n\nBANKY\nHalf's not good enough?  Fine--I'll\ngive you two-thirds of what I made!\n\nJAY\nFuck-you--you already said half? You\ncan't take it back!\n\nSilent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.\n\nBANKY\nDone\n\nJustice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing\neach other.\n\nSISSY\nYour shit is so tired, Justice!\n\nJUSTICE\nCall me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!\n\nJustice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.\n\nSissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop\nMissy and Chrissy, knocking them out.\n\nWillenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nHello? Truce?\n(beat)\nI think I killed both of them.\n\nSuddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing\na tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind\nhim, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her\nhandiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.\n\nJUSTICE\nC'mon guys. It's over.\n\nJay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.\n\nJAY\nYo, I was just about to jump in there\nand get your back.\n\nThen, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.\n\nJAY\nHoly shit, the cops! We gotta get\nout of here!\n\nJUSTICE\nNo. I'm tired of running.\n\nJustice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps\nhis face.\n\nJUSTICE\nYou awake, Marshal? Marshal?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(tries to move but\ncan't)\nOh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey\nshot me in the ass and paralyzed me!\nOh the irony!\n\nJUSTICE\n(off Suzanne's gun)\nYou're not paralyzed. It was just a\ntranquilizer.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nJesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!\nMy friends in the Bureau are never\ngonna let me live this down!\n\nJUSTICE\nYou have friends in the F.B.I.?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\n(crying)\nThey all made it in, but I failed\nthe exam. Why the hell else do you\nthink I became a Federal Wildlife\nMarshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!\n\nJustice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking.\nThen--\n\nJUSTICE\nMaybe not. I can make you a deal\nthat'll get you into the F.B.I.,\nregardless of test scores.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWhat kind of deal?\n\nJUSTICE\nYou drop the charges against Jay and\nSilent Bob and say you never found\nthe ape.  Make sure the world knows\nthey're not in control of any C.L.I.T.\n\nJAY\nNow wait a second--\n\nJUSTICE\nI'll explain later, Jay\n(to Willenholly)\nIn exchange, I'll give you the\ndiamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,\nMissy, Chrissy, and myself. But I\nwant a reduced sentence.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYou'd be willing to do that?\n\nJUSTICE\n(off Jay)\nFor him? I'd be willing to do\nanything.\n\nJustice stands and takes Jay by the hands.\n\nJUSTICE\nI'm an international jewel thief\nwho's facing a jail sentence.\n\nJAY\nThat's alright. I'm a junkie with a\nmonkey.\n\nJUSTICE\nIf I go to prison, will you wait for\nme?\n\nJAY\nI don't know. Will we fuck when you\nget out?\n\nJustice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should\nsay it all, but--\n\nJAY\nDon't change the subject. Will we\nfuck when you get out?\n\nJUSTICE\nSnoogans.\n\nJustice and Jay kiss again.\n\nSuzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs\nhis face and kisses him.\n\nWillenholly looks to Banky.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nWow. There's a lot of love in the\nroom.\n\nBANKY\nRegardless of what you may have heard.\nI do not kiss guys.\n\nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER\n\nJustice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls\nher away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nSorry, Justice. We've gotta go.\n(to Jay: friendly)\nHey--stop stealing monkeys.\n\nJAY\nFuck you.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nFair enough.\n\nWillenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the\ncar.\n\nJUSTICE\n(to Jay)\nWait for me.\n\nJAY\nWhat--here?\n\nJay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,\nleaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking\ndown the lot.\n\nBANKY\nWell, boys--you're rich in love--\n(indicating Jay)\nWell, you're in love. And to top\nthat off, you've got your own monkey.\nWhat more could two guys from Jersey\npossibly want?\n\nJAY\nAll those fucks to stop talking shit\nabout us on the Internet, for\nstarters.\n\nBANKY\nWhat do I keep telling you? There's\nnot much you can do to stop that.\nWell, short of showing up at all\ntheir houses and beating the shit\nout of them, I guess.\n\nJay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and\nsmile.\n\nJAY\n(to Bob)\nYou know--with all that money we're\ngonna make we can buy a lotta plane\ntickets.\n\nSTART THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE\n\nEXT. SKY--DAY\n\nA passenger JET flies through the sky.\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY\n\nJay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check\nthe address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod\nat each other, and cross the street.\n\nINT. HOUSE--DAY\n\nThe doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent\nBob standing in the doorway.\n\nMOTHER\nCan I help you?\n\nJAY\nYes. Ma'am, Does--\n(reading of paper)\nWilliam Dusky live here?\n\nMOTHER\nYes. He's my son.\n\nJAY\nMay we talk to him, please.\n\nMOTHER\nOne moment.\n\nShe walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes\nto the door.\n\nKID\nYeah?\n\nJAY\nYo--do you post as--\n(reading off paper)\nMagnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?\n\nKID\nYeah.\n\nJAY\nAnd did you write \"Fuck Jay and Silent\nBob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?\n\nKID\nYeah, a while ago. So?\n\nJay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him\noutside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front\nlawn.\n\nEXT. SKY--DAY\n\nThe passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY\n\nJay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.\nThey speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the\ndoor.\n\nJAY\nOn Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say\nJay and Silent Bob--\n(reading off paper)\n\"--are fucking clown shoes. If they\nwere real, I'd beat the shit out of\nthem for being so stupid.\"\n\nKID\n(chuckling)\nYeah.\n\nJAY\nReally--\n\nAgain, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit\nout of him.\n\nINT.

RECTORY--DAY\n\nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.\n\nINT. OFFICE--DAY\n\nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.\n\nEXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT\n\nThe marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE\nBLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!\n\nWORLD PREMIERE!\n\nThe front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see\nDANTE and RANDAL.\n\nRANDAL\nNow that was worse then Clash of the\nTitans.\n\nDANTE\nI still can't believe Judy Dench\nplayed me.\n\nRANDAL\nHey--remind me to renew that\nrestraining order.\n\nDANTE\nWhy?\n\nRANDAL\nBecause I'm gonna blast the flick on\nthe Internet tonight.\n\nSTEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.\n\nSTEVE-DAVE\nWhy can't Hollywood ever make a decent\ncomic book movie?\n\nWALT\nTell'em Steve-Dave!\n\nSTEVE-DAVE\nWould you stop saying that?\n\nALYSSA and TRISH come out.\n\nTRISH\nWell, that was just another paean to\nmale adolescence and its refusal to\ngrow up.\n\nALYSSA\nYeah, sis--but it was better than\nMallrats. At least Holden had the\ngood sense to keep his name off of\nit.\n\nTRISH\nWhy wouldn't Miramax option his other\ncomic instead? You know--the one he\ndrew about you and him and your\nrelationship?\n\nALYSSA\nYou mean Chasing Amy? That would\nnever work as a movie.\n\nBANKY and HOOPER exit.\n\nBANKY\nI'm so fucking embarrassed--\n\nHOOPER\nHoney, you should be. They took your\ncharacters and reduced them to one\nninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was\nlike watching Batman and Robin again.\n\nBANKY\nThanks. That means a lot coming from\nthe guy who pretends to be Shaft as\nopposed to the guy who takes shaft.\n\nHOOPER\nI don't hear you complaining nightly.\nIn fact, the only thing I do hear\nyou say is \"Yes, Hooper! Cradle the\nballs and work the shaft!\"\n\nBANKY\n(looking around)\nHey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in\npublic!\n\nA guy behind them calls out to Banks.\n\nGUY\nNice movie, you fucking Tracer!\n\nBANKY\n(recognizing him)\nYou--!\n\nGUY\nThat's right, you sonovabitch! I'm\nback for round two!\n\nBanky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him,\nwhile Hooper tries to break them up.\n\nWILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a\nprison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nYou know, I don't get out to the\nmovies much. But I'd have to say\nBluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!\n\nJUSTICE\nAre these leg cuffs really necessary?\n\nWILLENHOLLY\nDon't make me shoot you, Justice.\n\nAnd finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.\n\nJAY\nYO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,\nFEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE\nWORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!\n\nWHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing\n\"The Bird.\" During the song, Morris points to--\n\nJay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's\nstill in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob,\nthey nod at each other and--\n\nJay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage,\nand dance us out to the coda, which reads--\n\nCODA\n\nBluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3\nmillion at the box office. It was the biggest commercial\nfailure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly\ndrubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat\nboards, and over the course of the next year, while they\nwaited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay\nand Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out\nof them.\n\nCREDITS.
