Ah\nMy assessment's in the highest percentile\nI feel like the chosen one surrounded by gentiles\nGerman engineering on the Glocks and whips\nWith a Chinese chick in rush hour like Juntao\nPush it to the limit, my port of Miami Zos\nRock, Voodoo beads, do ceremony with skulls\nThey'll sacrifice you then pray to your bones\nBlow up, your whole block like a Syrian drone\nI'm up top with a bird's eye view, ready to drop shit\nHairpin trigger extended in fiber optics\nThe ops, get a synopsis, can't say too much\nDon't want to end up like Martha with them stock tips\nI'm more Siddhartha, Buddha in his early stages\nThey say it's a law but move my mule, I need my 40 acres\nWho wanna tango and dance? I'll have your mans\nPourin' out drinks for you champ, word to Noreaga\nFrom the home of Capone and Minister Farrakhan\nBlack entrepreneurs homie, shiftin' the paradigm\nWith two certified 10s, that's a pair of dimes\nFace down from the waist down 'til I'm paralyzed\nMoroccan beauty wanna do me in Marrakesh\nI'm Gil Scott but my revolution is televised\nWord to the wise, you should be terrified\nHow can you threaten death with a man who already died?\nSave Money still alive and breathin'\nI'm the original, Adam in the Garden of Eden\nI rose from the ashes, how could you bury a phoenix?\nMy name legend as if I was married to Chrissy Teigen\nThese days in the streets, get rich or die tryin'\nEither go hard in the paint, or sit on the sidelines\nI'm on a death race like drive-bys on I-95\nI'm Dylan, I want every spot in the top five\nI can see telepathically, niggas ain't even half of me\nThey all scrubs, Jesse Williams, Grey's Anatomy\nI'm in you like a slave mentality\nI'm the god, I was raised in Nazareth, they gotta hate me, they Pharisees\nHamdulillah survived in Chiraq\nWhere the violence surrounds your vision like IMAX\nI'm on network TV but play me and catch a clip\nBe on the next murder mystery series on Netflix\nIndustry in shambles, I gotta lead by example\nNiggas scared to tell the truth, out of fear of getting cancelled\nCool, I'm the one that put my life on the line\nSaving the game like I'm on the frontline with Private Ryan\nStill, I feel like they withholding my respect\nLike Uncle Sam withholding O's outta your check\nLook, most niggas I know in debt\nGettin' stains for simple things, designer clothes, diapers and rent\n2018 they tried to assassinate me\n50 racks on my top, not no rap game beef\nShit got funky, I called General Kumasi\nI was on Slauson with OG Blue from Long Beach\nNiggas die young or you live and you learn\nWe called Big U, watched as niggas did a U-turn\nThis around the time I did the video with the dress on\nI still had that burner on deck, like Steph arm\nNot to mention, more bitches than I could count\n24 have fivesomes with millions in my account\nYour spouse, in multimillion dollar houses\nI'm still ballin' on niggas that's game, blouses\nIt's just a sign of the times\nYou can't marginalize me, I'm livin' out of your lines\nMenace to sobriety, anti-society\nSelassie flow, y'all gotta speak of me higher-ly\nLow center of gravity in the Lambo seats\nFlyin' business international like Amnesty\nBlood on the money like Israeli arms dealers\nStill screamin' out free Palestine, nigga\n30 got more shells than a whole family of armadillos\nJane Goodall, I be with gorillas\nYou won't see my killers nor will you hear 'em comin'\nNow you Hellen Keller, call them boys Philip 'cause they drummin'\nMe, I'm on base like a timpani\nThis a stroke of genius, Mozart's fifth symphony\nBoxing like Tyson but I'm actin' like Cicely\nI got mob ties like I had family in Sicily\nIt seems the world has succumbed to sensitivity\nThey tryin' to censor me 'cause they can't make sense of me\nI'm still Save Money, send my cheese where the Swisses be\nThe Tiffanys, make a thot come like an epiphany\nThis is immaculate conception\nI'm goin' in like I'm black and fit the description\nY'all spit opinions, the facts, often different\nMy shooter rock a mask, Rip Hamilton on the Pistons\nDrippin' D'Ussé, libation fallen soldiers\nCelebrate to see they son become winner like autumn's over\nIn the field where the fathers ain't coach us\nWe got God inside us, that's how Mary had Jesus without Joseph\nPray one day I have seeds, I'll teach 'em these lessons\nWritten language and paper was really Egypt's inventions\nThey killed the natives with disease and infection\nSection 8 housing, now we got 8 bottles of Ace in our section\nYou do the math, all off of sixteens on these records\n23 I saw my first M, like when you first heard Slim\nSince him back like Mike with the .45\nIf you could add, that's no surprise, I keep it a hundred\nAnd I'm still in the streets whippin' 350 AMG\nOne thing left in the trunk, I feel like Amerie\nAll the ops laggin' behind us, they got latency\nThey know it's gon' be violence like a orchestra, they play with me\nI orchestrated enterprises from direct deposits\nNiggas love to say I flopped but I was really catchin' charges\nWith the steppers on some Stomp the Yard shit\nI made her cum louder but I never took a step in college\nI said that before, y'all never caught it\nI'm still a hooligan, grown and developed like Hoov' 'n 'em\nSending Jeff Fort bread in the same fed that Hoover's in\nYa' squad full of geeks, don't make me bring the trouble shooters in\nY'all judge y'all successes by the likes and mentions\nI judge mines by the lives that my mic affected\nSecurus Calls nine to five from inside corrections\nBro said it made him shed a tear to hear me talkin' reckless\nI rhyme for every child neglected\nEBT users and students swiping Link Cards for breakfast\n2018 they tried to stop the message\nIt's real bodies drop behind that rap beef, I keep that off the recordEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy" ;
