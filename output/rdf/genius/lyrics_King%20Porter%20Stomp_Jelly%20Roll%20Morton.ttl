        xyz:lyrics    "[Instrumental]\n\n[Postlude - Spoken]\nNow \"King Porter\" was the first stomp, or the first tune with the name stomp, wrote in the United States\n[clears throat] You must pardon me for clearing my throat, 'cause I've gotta do it occasionally\n\nOf course, I'll tell you the fact about it, I don't know what the name stomp mean, myself. It really wasn't any meaning, only that people would stamp their feet, and I decided that the name stomp would be fitted for it\n\nOf course, this tune . . . I was inspired by the name from a very dear friend of mine, and a marvelous pianist, now in the cold, cold ground - a gentleman from Florida, an educated gentleman with a wonderful musical education, far much better than mine. Now this gentleman's name was Mr. King - Porter King. And of course, he seemed to have a kind of a yen for my style of playing, although we had two different styles of playing.  And of course he particularly liked this type of number that I'm playing, and that was the reason that I named it after him. But not Porter King, I changed the name backwards and named it \"King Porter Stomp\"\n\nNow this tune become the biggest, the outstanding favorite of every hot band throughout the world that had the accomplishments, the qualifications of playing it. And until today, this tune has been the cause of many great bands to come to fame.  It has caused the outstanding tunes today to use the backgrounds that belong to King Porter in all that make great tunes of themselves\n\n(question in the background) When did you write this song?\n\nThis tune was wrote the same your as \"Alabama Bound\" in 1905EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy" ;
