Oh yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour smile\nSpeaks books to me\nI break up\nWith each and every one\nOf your looks at me\nHoney, you're starting something\nDeep inside of me\nHoney, you're sparking something\nThis fire in me\nI'm outta control, I want to rush\nHeadlong into this ecstasy\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough!\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nOh yeah\n\n[Instrumental break]\n(Breakthrough)\n(Breakthrough)\n(Break-)\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\n\n[Outro]\nBreakthrough!" ;
