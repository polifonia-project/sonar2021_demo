What's the hold up?\nWhen's it gone be my turn I want a blow up?\nThe paper said 3:30 I'm here, I showed up\nMy bag got my gear, headshots, look these sluts\nAin't got nothing on me\nI was awarded Miss Edmonton in 93\nAnd graduated to be Miss Grand Prix\nOnly get manicures from the finest boutiques\nSee my hair, this is mine, I don't wear no weaves\nWhy I'm waiting in this line when I got a degree\nStill I'm young, got time to chase my dreams\nBut the more I run the further they seem\nTo invest my time in vanity things\nWhen they only looking for ass and tit rings\nMaybe I think I'll pass on this thing\nGo back to class and be queen\n\n[Spoken Word - Young Mav]\t\nAre you driven by self-esteem?\nOr selfish themes?\nThat promote hair weaves\nAnd lightning creams\nScared of enlightenment\nSo you lighten they're tint\nTo be the next video hoe\nThat your friends resent\nVanity is our demise\nSo late we realize\nWe'd all look the same\nIf we had no eyes" ;
