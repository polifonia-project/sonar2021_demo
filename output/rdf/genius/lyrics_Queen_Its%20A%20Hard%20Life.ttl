It's a hard life\nIn a world that's filled with sorrow\nThere are people searching\nFor love in every way\nIt's a long hard fight (hard fight!)\nBut I'll always live for tomorrow\nI'll look back on myself\nAnd say I did it for love\n\n[Outro]\nYes, I did it for love\nFor love\nOh, oh, oh I did it for love" ;
