Hey boy\"\nSet my alarm, turn on my charm\nThat's because I'm a good\nOld-fashioned lover boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nOoh, let me feel\nYour heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)\nOoh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)\nCome on and sit on my hot seat of love\nAnd tell me how do you feel right after all\nI'd like for you and I to go romancing\nSay the word, your wish\nIs my command\n\n[Chorus]\n“Ooh love, Ooh lover boy\nWhat’re you doing tonight? Hey boy”\nWrite my letter, feel much better\nI’ll use my fancy patter on the telephone\n[Bridge]\nWhen I'm not with you\nThink of you always\nI miss you\n(I miss those long hot summer nights)\nWhen I'm not with you\nThink of me always\nLove you, Love you\nHey boy where do you get it from?\nHey boy where did you go?\nI learned my passion\nIn the good old fashioned\nSchool of lover boys\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine\n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock) precisely\nI will pay the bill, you taste the wine\nDriving back in style\nIn my saloon will do quite nicely\nJust take me back to yours\nThat will be fine (Come on and get it)\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Ooh love (There he goes again)\nOoh lover boy (Who's my good\nOld-fashioned lover boy? ooh ooh)\nWhat're you doing tonight, hey boy\"\nEverything's all right, just hold on tight\nThat's because I'm a good old\nFashioned (Fashioned) lover boy35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy" ;
