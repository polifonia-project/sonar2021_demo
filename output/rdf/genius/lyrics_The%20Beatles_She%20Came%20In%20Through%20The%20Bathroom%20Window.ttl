It's-\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe came in through the bathroom window\nProtected by a silver spoon\nBut now she sucks her thumb and wanders\nBy the banks of her own lagoon\n\n[Chorus]\nDidn't anybody tell her?\nDidn't anybody see?\nSunday's on the phone to Monday\nTuesday's on the phone to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said she'd always been a dancer\nShe worked at fifteen clubs a day\nAnd though she thought I knew the answer\nWell, I knew what I could not say\nAnd so I quit the police department\nAnd got myself a steady job\nAnd though she tried her best to help me\nShe could steal, but she could not rob\n\n[Chorus]\nDidn't anybody tell her?\nDidn't anybody see?\nSunday's on the phone to Monday\nTuesday's on the phone to me\n\n[Outro]\nOh yeah" ;
