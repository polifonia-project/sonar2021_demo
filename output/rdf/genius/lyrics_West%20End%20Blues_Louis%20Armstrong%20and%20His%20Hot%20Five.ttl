He drags a brush through his\nfinger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark\nof imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.\nANCHOR (O.S.)\nOutrage over an “African American\nThemed” party organized by\npredominately white students of\nManchester University has resulted\nin rioting and property damages.\n2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue 2A\neyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.\nANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)\nGuests were invited to “liberate\ntheir inner Negro, fry up chicken,\nenjoy a sugar water concoction\nknown as Purple drank and wear\noversized Barack Obama T-shirts.”\n2B COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts 2B\nadjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the\nsmall TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips. *\nANCHOR (CONT’D)\nOfficials claim an investigation is\nunderway to find those responsible\nfor the event and subsequent riot.\n2C SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an 2C\nedit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro\npompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.\nANCHOR (CONT’D)\nIn an effort to address diversity\nissues, the school appointed\nAfrican American scholar Dr. Walter\nFairbanks as Dean of Students.\n2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D\nglasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains\nhis otherwise boyish face.\nANCHOR (CONT’D)\nLast year the Dean’s office\ncelebrated slight gains in diverse\napplicants but with many now\ncalling for Fairbanks' resignation,\nthat may have been pre-mature.\n2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E\n50’s fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.\nANCHOR (CONT’D)\nUp next, a cat that loves to water\nski? That and more after the break.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHow could this happen?\nTITLE CARD: FIVE WEEKS AGO\n3 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 3\nThis sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern\narchitecture is presented like a living brochure.\nSUPERIMPOSE: MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - “NOSCE TE IPSUM”\nAs we cut through the living brochure, we’re presented with\ngroups and programs. Their CRESTS and titles SUPERIMPOSED.\nSERIES OF SHOTS - TOP ACADEMIC PROGRAMS\n3A White kids with “Trump” blazers and glares - DESMOND 3A\nSCHOOL OF BUSINESS.\n3B Kids with dark eye circles and unkempt hair stand before 3B\nthe BING SCHOOL OF HISTORY.\n3C A cluster of skinny jeans and expressive hands before the 3C\nGOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL. ONE BLACK KID stands in the back.\nSAM (V.O.)\nDear White People. The minimum\nrequirement of Black friends needed\nto not seem racist has just been\nraised to two.\n4 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 4\nSamantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way\nwindow with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older.\nShe gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a\nsubversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan.\nSUPERIMPOSE: SAMANTHA WHITE, SENIOR, VISUAL AND NEW MEDIA\n2.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nSorry, but your weed man Tyrone\ndoes not count.\nShe fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to\naddress a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title\n“EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE.” One by one she scribbles\nher autograph on the books.\n5 EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY 5\nSERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS\nDisheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE.\n5A Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A\n5B Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. His sweet but 5B\ninsecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head.\nSUPERIMPOSE: LIONEL HIGGINS, JUNIOR, PHILOSOPHY UNDECLARED\nSTUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his\nalready full hands. Lionel’s a guppy. The kind that gets\neaten alive in a tank of sharks.\nAs Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he\nchecks his pockets. He’s missing something. Shit.\nLIONEL\n(knocking)\nKurt! You home?\nLionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from\ninside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel’s.\nANSWERING MACHINE\nHey boyssss, you’ve reached Lionel\nHigginsss, the only bitch on\ncampussss who’ll give you a\ndickssscount. That’s right hunty,\nthe bigger the dick the less you’ll\nhave to pay me to ssssuck it.\nThe beep sounds. Lionel’s in shock. Should he hang up? Or...\nLIONEL\nKurt. It’s Lionel. I’m locked out.\nAs Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he\nunfolds the flyer he was just handed. It’s a rendering of Sam\nWhite on a carton of milk with the caption:\n“MISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK”\n3.\n6 EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY 6\nSigns scream out “ORIENTATION” as jazz music wafts from the\nlaptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, apparently\nMorgan Freeman in “Deep Impact”\nwasn’t enough. Despite two terms\nObama could cure Cancer and\nsomewhere White folks will be\nembroiled in protest. And he’s only\nhalf Black.\nGABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy\nhair and “laundry day” flip flop clad ensemble, catches the\nend of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...\n7 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 7\n...Sam presses a button next to a red light on her controls.\nSAM\nTalk to me.\nINTERCUT with Gabe walking about on campus.\nGABE\nWhat would you say if someone\nstarted a Dear Black People?\nSAM\n(recognizing the voice)\nNo need. Mass media from Fox News\nto reality tv on VH1 makes it clear\nwhat white people think of us.\n8 EXT. MANCHESTER COURT - DAY 8\nSERIES OF SHOTS - POPULAR RESIDENCE HALLS\nManchester’s white and rich elite before BECHET HOUSE.\n8A Athletes of many disciplines before WEBSTER HOUSE. 8A\n8B An eclectic group of Black students with some Latinos and 8B\na sprinkling of whites before ARMSTRONG / PARKER HOUSE.\nCOCO (V.O.)\nI’m fucking pissed...\n4.\n11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11\nColandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes\nright at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She’s\ngot an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.\nCOCO (YOUTUBE)\n...I am! The whole point of\nrandomized housing is to mix shit\nup. I’m out here trying to find the\nOlivier to my Halle Berry, and\nthey’ve got me looking like an\nextra on a Different World...\nThe video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a\n30’s something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy\neverything. Too stylish for this place. If he’s impressed,\nit’s barely perceptible.\nHELMUT\nYou call your Youtube show “Doing\nTime at an Ivy League?”\nHe stares right at Coco, there in the flesh.\nCOCO\nIn my second year of a four year\nsentence. Wanted to go to New York.\nSUPERIMPOSE: COLANDREA COCO CONNERS, SOPHOMORE, ECONOMICS\nHELMUT\nYeah? And do what?\nCOCO\nThings my mama taught me not to.\nYou know get in a lot of trouble\nand become famous for it. But alas\nI didn’t get into Tisch...\nHELMUT\nArmstrong / Parker? That your\nrooming assignment?\nCOCO\nTraditionally it’s where the\nhopelessly Afrocentric gather to\nprocess their guilt over not going\nto an HBCU.\n(off Helmut’s look)\nWhere the Negros be at.\nHELMUT\nThat’s not where you want to be?\n5.\nCOCO\nBechet House is more my style.\nHELMUT\nWith the rich white kids.\nCOCO\nExcuse me?\nHELMUT\nWhat part of Chicago you from?\nCOCO\nHyde Park.\nHELMUT\nWhat street?\nCOCO\nSeventy Eighth and --\nHELMUT\n-- Seventy Eighth is Southside\nsweetheart. And you know what they\nsay. You can take the girl out the\nhood but --\nCOCO\n-- Ain’t nothing hood about me.\nHELMUT\nThanks so much for coming in.\nCoco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.\nCOCO\nSo what’s this show about anyway?\nHELMUT\nHere’s the way reality works\nsweetheart, I’m the producer. I ask\nthe questions. Be in touch.\nAnd with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders\nbefore unmuting his iPad.\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People I am here to\nburst your post-racial little\nbubble.\n6.\n(MORE)\nYes Oprah may have her own network,\nbut Ann Coulter is still writing\nbest sellers, Black kids are still\ngetting shot for wearing hoodies,\nand even here the few vestiges of\nBlack culture are under attack by\nconservative groups, trustees and\nyes our very own President\nFletcher.\nHelmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.\nHELMUT\nThis is the school radio?\n13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13\nA pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the\nhalls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively\ndebates, flirt and bump the student radio.\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, thanks to the\nnew process of randomizing housing\nassignments for Sophomores, some of\nyou may be jarred by an assignment\nto Armstrong/Parker house.\nThe owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks.\nTROY\nSomeone turn that trash off.\nSUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE\nEven with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of\nJet. Troy exudes “approachable homie” as he spots a small\ngroup of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nNewbies right?\nThe white sophomores nod their heads yes.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nWelcome to Armstrong / Parker, home\nof the dopest dining hall in all of\nManchester. I’m Troy, Head of\nHouse.\nSOPHOMORE\nWhat’s up my brother?\n7.\nSAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)\nSAM (O.S.)\nWhen encountering a Black person\ntry and stay calm. Don’t say things\nlike “what’s up” and “my brotha”\nThat’s not how you normally talk.\nTROY\nYa’ll take care. Nice Jordan’s bro.\nCoco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette\nwho exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.\nSOFIA\nYour hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.\nCOCO\nYou’re so cute.\nSOFIA\nIs it weaved?\nCoco’s face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.\nSOFIA (CONT’D)\nI saw “Good Hair” in Afro studies.\nCOCO\n(moving on)\nHey what house did you get?\nSOFIA\nHuh? Oh Bechet bitch.\nCOCO\nOf course. The mere thought of a\nFletcher anywhere else...\nSOFIA\nEasy, it was the luck of the draw.\nDaddy had nothing to do with it.\nCoco rolls her eyes behind a smile.\nSOFIA (CONT’D)\nAnd honestly, if I had to pick\nanywhere to be it’d be here.\nSofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.\nCOCO\nI’m down to switch if you are. You\nget your Denzel. I get my Gosling.\n8.\nSOFIA\nOh I got mines. Want to meet him?\nThey turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new\nSophomores. Coco’s caught off guard by his looks.\nCOCO\nCute...\n(off Sofia’s jealous\nglance)\n...for a Black boy.\nTroy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.\nSOFIA\nHey boo. This is my friend Coco.\nShe’s new to the house.\nTROY\nHey I’m Troy. Welcome to Armstrong\n/ Parker, home of the dopest --\nSOFIA\n-- Are we on duty?\nTROY\nHead of House is always on duty.\nCOCO\nNice to meet you. I should get\nsettled. Thanks Sof!\nSofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down\nthe hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy’s ass.\nTROY\nThink I got time for a quick cut?\nSOFIA\nYou got it cut last week.\nTROY\nIt’s a Black thing babe.\nSOFIA\nSince when is OCD a Black thang?\nTROY\nDon’t say “thang” like that.\nSOFIA\nBesides you’ve got a shift at the\nPoliticos booth, then a shift at\nOrientation, then your advisor --\n9.\nTROY\n-- I’ll just wear a hat.\nSOFIA\nThen a movie maybe? Just us?\nTROY\nElection night. Babe, come on.\nSofia holds her tongue. Troy ignores this as he spots...\nTROY (CONT’D)\nYo, Kurt my man.\n14 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14\n...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical\nknowing glare. We recognize them from the “Pastiche” portrait\nfrom before.\nAs they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt’s\nglare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.\nKURT\nSis.\nSofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of\nhis dismissal.\nThey both spot Sam’s “Missing: Black culture” flyers.\nTROY\nIs she kidding with this?\nSOFIA\nYou don’t have to run again. Just\nbecause it’s her doesn’t mean --\nTROY\n-- I can’t let Sam and her wannabe\nBlack Panthers take the House. The\nHouse needs me. This is who I am.\nSOFIA\nIt’s who he wants you to be.\nTroy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.\nTROY\nOh so you pick up a Psych class you\nthink you Freud or something? Huh?\nSOFIA\nA Freud reference. Sophisticated.\n10.\nTROY\n(seducing)\nFine Beck, Jung, Maslow...\nTroy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring\nstacks of Sam’s “EBONY & IVY.” The booth is manned by REGGIE,\n21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both\nbohemian and radical.\nTroy glares at Sam’s picture on the book. It’s on. There’s a\nhistory between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie’s laptop we hear...\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, this just in.\nDating a Black person to piss off\nyour parents is a form of racism.\nSofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.\nREGGIE\nYo Troy I forget. Is your major in\nshucking or was it jiving?\nTROY\nMy major’s in Jive. Minoring in\nShuck. You’re still majoring in\ntrying to fuck my left overs right?\nTroy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.\nSOFIA\nYou need a shower.\n15 INT. TROY’S BATHROOM - DAY 15\nWater runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over\nthe toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a\npaper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He\njots something down on a notepad as he whispers...\nTROY\nYou went from ODB to Trey Songz...\n16 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT 16\nThe hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black.\nHelmut West watches from the back.\nTROY\nArtie, you know your success ratio\nwith the ladies went up like thirty\npercent after I started edging you\nup dog, come on. You went from ODB\nto Trey Songz!\n11.\nThe audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone\nexcept Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro’d bohemian\ndisciples (who we’ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the\nproceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.\nREGGIE\nThat’s his platform? Haircuts?\nSAM\nOofta is as Oofta does.\nCoco, sneaks through the door. She’s got the eyes of Helmut\non her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she\nsits in the only open spot next to...\nSAM (CONT’D)\nJust because we’re colored don’t\nmean we run on colored people time.\nCOCO\nBoycotting hot combs don’t make you\nan expert on “colored people” boo.\nCoco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.\nTROY\nNo but seriously, I care about you\nguys. I care about this house. We\nhad a great year last year and if\nit ain’t broke...\nTroy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.\nSam doesn’t want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.\nREGGIE\nJust pretend like you’re in the\nbooth. Just you and the mic.\nSAM\nHate this shit.\nAs Sam gets up and passes Troy --\nTROY\nYou really think you can take this\nfrom me?\nSAM\nTroy we live in a world where\nthere’s a Big Momma’s House 3. I\ndon’t have a chance in hell. Thank\nGod.\n12.\nSam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nTroy my brother, it’s broke.\nThe BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nTroy’s a legacy kid. And yet it’s\nunder his watch that Armstrong /\nParker, the bastion of Black\nculture here was gutted. By the\nRandomization of Housing Act.\nSecond years of color no longer\nhave a say in where they go. The\nculture that’s been fostered in\nthis house for two decades will be\nwiped out in two years.\nTroy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --\nSAM (CONT’D)\nThis wasn’t motivated by a desire\nto mix things up. Bring about\nracial and socioeconomic harmony.\nNo, the Black kids are sitting\ntogether in the proverbial\ncafeteria and they must be up to no\ngood.\nCoco’s eyes are in the back of her head.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nWe sit together to protect\nourselves. Over a century of houses\ngrouped by sports affiliations,\npolitical leanings, majors, you\nname it. Black folks get their own\nhouse, suddenly we got a problem?\nStudents look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam\ndelivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nThis Act doesn’t affect the other\nhouses like it does ours. There are\nplenty of trustees, former coaches,\nand presidents watching out for the\nothers. All we have is a Dean who’d\nrather please his massa --\nTROY\n-- Yo that’s enough of that Sam --\n13.\nSAM\n-- then stand up for his own. Look,\nI know ya’ll ain’t voting for me.\nYa’ll ain’t ready and I didn’t come\nhere for that. The Black Student\nUnion and I have brought a petition\nto repeal the Randomization of\nHousing Act. I plan on bringing it\nto the President and together we\ncan bring Black back to Manchester.\nIt’ll be by the door.\nSam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy\n- give her daps and all sorts of praise.\nMARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with\nneat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.\nMARTIN\nI assume everyone has the app I\ncreated by now?\nREGGIE\n(aside)\nIt’s a child’s app...\nMARTIN\nGood. Voting may commence.\nEveryone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view\nas he punches something in.\nTroy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who\ngive him a head nod. Troy’s got this. After a moment...\nMARTIN (CONT’D)\nOkay. Looks like we’ve got\nourselves a winner.\n(devastated)\nSam White?\nThe blood drains from Sam’s face and Troy’s smile plummets\ninto the floor as the two turn to look at each other.\nTROY & SAM\nOh shit.\nReggie’s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and\nslips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.\n17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17\nRight on the heels of Helmut’s exit is...\n14.\nCOCO\nSo that’s what you’re looking for?\nHELMUT\nI’m looking for good TV sister.\nCOCO\nI think I’d be good TV.\nHELMUT\nYou’re at a great school, getting a\ngreat education. Be good at that.\nCOCO\nI am. And when I graduate early\nwith an Economics degree from\nManchester it will be the crowning\nachievement of my Black middle\nclass parents’ ambitions.\nHELMUT\nConflict is a commodity in my\nindustry. Sam’s got it. Do you?\nCOCO\nSo you want me to start a fight.\nHELMUT\n(exactly)\nI don’t want you to do anything you\nwouldn’t otherwise do.\nHelmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.\nHe contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.\n18 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 18\nA fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while\nthe message plays over speaker phone.\nSPEAKER\n...bigger the dick the less you’ll\nhave to pay me to ssssuck it.\nDean Fairbank’s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMost everything’s locked up, but\nwe’ll find another residence to\nmove you to. Third time’s a charm.\n(off Lionel’s sigh)\nWhat about Armstrong / Parker?\n15.\nLIONEL\nI don’t know...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI might have an opening. Maybe it’d\nbe good to be around...you know.\nLIONEL\nDean. The worst thing about high\nschool, and believe me it was a\nlong list, were the Black kids.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMaybe it’s in your head. Sure,\nsometimes our folks can be\nintolerant around people like you.\nHomo --\nLIONEL\n-- I don’t believe in labels.\nFairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.\nLionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank’s desk: Students\nof all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy\nwith the phrase “MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG” printed below.\nTroy’s huge smile seems to mock him.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou like jazz Lionel? Manchester’s\nlike jazz you know.\nLIONEL\nThis is a research school.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAnd jazz is tension. The interplay\nof improvised solos all creating\none song. Your problem is you’ve\ngot no instrument. No major, no\naffiliations, no solo son.\nLIONEL\nI submit articles to the\nIndependent Observer.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNo one reads the Independent\nObserver, my point is are you\nplaying swing or bebop?\nLIONEL\nYou’re mixing metaphors.\n16.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAre you a sax or are you a trumpet?\nLIONEL\nI hate jazz.\nFairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI’ll do what I can. Not a word of\nthis in the Observer okay?\nLIONEL\nWhat’s it matter? No one reads it.\n19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19\nLionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out\nto..\n...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself\namongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he\ntrades “No Homo’s” with the others.\nLionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud\ngay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his\nhair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.\nNot right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...\nGEORGE\nLionel right?\nGEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from\nNietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nGeorge. We had Civ last semester?\nHow you doing?\nLIONEL\nGrood...Gate...I’m ah..\nGEORGE\nFan of your stuff. In the Observer?\nLIONEL\nNo one reads the Observer.\nGEORGE\nYou seen this?\nGeorge hands Lionel Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyer.\n17.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nThe residents of Armstrong / Parker\njust made her head of house. Am I\ncrazy or is there a there there?\nLIONEL\nWhat made you come over here?\nGeorge holds up Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy.” Lionel takes it.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nI mean I’m glad you came --\nGEORGE\n-- My staff? God bless them.\nThey’re whiter than Michael\nJackson’s kids. We’re fucked if\nanyone of them writes this story\nand I will not let the transfers at\nthe Gazette do it first.\nLIONEL\nThe oldest one has his face.\nGEORGE\nYou’re in the Black Student Union.\nYou probably know Sam.\nLionel shakes his head “yes” and “no” at the same time.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nYou come up with a good angle? I\nwant it in the Bugle.\nLionel eyes the bold “Bugle” logo on George’s shirt.\nLIONEL\n(aside)\nTrumpet...\nGEORGE\nBugle. Focus. The only paper on\ncampus with a national subscription\nbase and an Advisor from the New\nYork Times? Only so many ways a\nperson can distinguish themselves\nat a place like this Lionel. You’re\ngood. You belong with us.\nThe way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we\nknow he’s never heard these words. Never belonged any place.\nDoesn’t hurt there’s a handsome boy smiling at him either.\n18.\n20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20\nTroy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their\nopposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall\nbetween them.\nTROY\nGet it yet?\nSam shakes her head yes.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nGood. You’ve now got the shared\ncalendar, contacts, and official\nemail.\nTroy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack\nof papers.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nOh and before I forget.\nSAM\nEvent requests for the year?\nTROY\nJust this month. They need your\napproval. Also don’t forget to pick\nyour office hours. At least 20 per\nweek.\nSAM\nThat’s absurd.\nTROY\nYou’re in charge of a hundred\nresidents now. And they need time\nto complain to your face. About\nnoise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free\noptions in the cafeteria. Etcetera.\nSAM\nTroy. I didn’t think I was going to\nwin.\nTROY\nAnd by the way petitioning the\nPresident on the Randomization of\nHousing Act isn’t gonna do shit.\nNone of the other houses are\nconcerned.\n19.\nSAM\nBecause they all have a legacy of\nrich and powerful allies on the\nboard who will make sure that\n“random” works out to their\nadvantage.\nTROY\nAnd you think a petition is going\nto change that?\nTroy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam’s\nphone buzzes: “MOM.” The letters chill Sam to the core.\n21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21\nLionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights\nwith a notepad. He flips through Sam’s “EBONY & IVY” book...\nSAM (V.O.)\nThe Armstrong / Parker dining hall\nis the epicenter of Black culture\nas it stands at Manchester. Only\nhere can you commiserate, celebrate\nand discuss everything from Kanye\nWest lyrics to theoretical\nrelativism all in one sitting. Not\nto mention find someone who can\nactually do your hair.\nARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS\nLionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this\nlively and somewhat alien dining hall.\nTroy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or\nso friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean\nart major.\nMARTIN\n“We wuz robbed.” That election was\nsuspect man.\nMartin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam\nbreaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.\nSAM\nYou call me the minute there’s an\nupdate. Love you too mom.\nSam hangs up. The call’s really put her in a bad place. She\nsits at a table of her Bofros - who we’ll name by their hair.\n20.\nCURLS\nThere is one other sister in my\nRelativity class, I’ll be damned if\nour professor doesn’t call me\nLaretta every God damn time.\nDREADS\nWe all look the same.\nREGGIE\nProgramming professor gets me and\nMartin here mixed up constantly.\nMARTIN\nYou should be so lucky.\nReggie glances over at Martin’s Mac Air.\nREGGIE\nCute.

Office hours and\npaperwork.\nSam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.\nREGGIE\nWinning was a happy accident. We\nwant the reform repealed right?\nCURLS\nMeans to an end, sister.\n21.\nSam feels the heat of her disciples’ eyes on her as the topic\nof the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with\na group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white\nand Black.\nCOCO\nThe talented tenth always has to\nbust its ass a little bit harder,\nbut I don’t see the benefit in\nblaming white folks for everything.\nCURLS\nWho’s blaming?\nTROY\nI don’t see the issue. I never had\none. Never ran into any lynch mobs.\nLionel takes a seat alone facing the action.\nKurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in\nthe heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.\nSAM\nLynch mob is still there. Just rebranded\nitself.\nTROY\nAs what pray tell?\nREGGIE\nThe Republican party.\nSAM\nWant to know how this world sees\nyou? Go to a Young Republican’s\nmeeting and bring up Welfare.\nSUNGMI\nOr Immigration.\nLIONEL\n(aside)\nOr gay equality.\nKURT\nBullshit.\nMARTIN\nI agree. Got something to add?\nKURT\nThe biggest athletes, movie stars,\nhell your president is Black.\n22.\n(MORE)\nSometimes I think the hardest thing\nto be in the American work force\nright now is an educated white guy.\nSUNGMI\nYou’re not serious.\nKURT\nYou guys still got affirmative\naction, you’re set.\nREGGIE\nThis shit.\nSAM\nWhat are you doing in here?\nKURT\nObama.

Bechet is that way.\nKURT\nYeah but what other dining hall\ngives you chicken and waffles? Dear\nWhite People right? Funny stuff.\nHow haven’t we staffed you yet?\nSAM\nOn Pastiche? Your uninspired humor\nmagazine?\nKURT\nWe’re a lot more than a magazine\nsweetie. SNL staff is basically\nhalf Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just\nlike the network comedies.\nA flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.\n23.\nKURT (CONT'D)\nSAM\nWhat gives you Clubhouse kids the\nright to come to our Dining Hall?\nKurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nYou don’t live here.\nMARTIN\nSam?

Kurt rolls his eyes to\nwhich Sam slams his tray to the ground.\nLionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.\nKURT\nYou got any idea who you’re --\nSAM\n-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.\nThe same one who’s been pushing to\nbreak up this House for a decade.\nWhat’s wrong? Is he scared letting\nthe Negroes gather in groups might\nstart a rebellion on the\nplantation? You tell him from\nme...he should be.\nKurt looks into Sam’s eyes and then his crew. They want out.\nKURT\nBad move.\n24.\nKurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight\nsnicker from Lionel which draws Sam’s eyes right to him.\nSomething sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts\nto GEORGE: “I’ve got the angle. I’m in.”\nSAM\nYou too.\nLIONEL\nMe?\nSAM\nIs this your house?\nLionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.\nSam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady\napplause. Troy and his table look around baffled.\nBy the caution on Sam’s face it seems the first time she’s\never heard this sound directed at her.\nA slight envy boils in Coco.\nOne last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.\nLocked out again.\n23 INT.

I hate to do it, but Imma\nhave to get real Black with you.\n(comes to mind)\nSo the other day, a girl had the\nnerve to fix her mouth and ask me\nif my hair was weaved.\n(after a moment)\nWeaved. Weaved bitch?\n25.\n(MORE)\nFirst of all if you’re going to fix\nyour mouth to ask me something like\nthat, say it right please? It’s\nweave. Noun. Present tense. Second\nof all don’t assume just because\nyou see a sister with some hair\nit’s a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a\nbitch could grow straight Indian\nhair directly out her own head I\nwouldn’t have just overdrafted my\naccount paying for this shit but\nthat ain’t your business. Are those\nyour lips sweetie? Sweet heart is\nthat really your skin? These white\ngirls and these tans I swear to\nGod, they’re starting to look\ndarker than me.\nCoco pauses it. Her mouse hovers over the check box next to\n“private.” Instead she plays it back...and hits “publish.”\nShe clicks back through to Sam’s last video and hits “reply.”\nAs the red light on her computer’s web cam turns green...\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nDear White People. What do I think\nabout it?\n24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24\nSam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam’s caller from\nearlier) presses play on a DVD.

Does anyone have any comments\nfor Sam’s “Rebirth of a Nation?”\nAll of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...\nPROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT’D)\nGabe, go ahead.\nGABE\nI dig the “silent movie” thing, but\nit’s a little self-congratulatory.\nLight on story and frankly\nthematically dubious.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nOkay. Anybody else?\nSAM\nWhat?\nSAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER\nAs students filter out of the class...\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nSam?\nSAM\nBefore you say anything might I\nremind you that I sat through Birth\nof A Nation, Gone With The Wind,\nand Tarantino week without protest.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nAnd might I remind you that I read\nall fifteen pages of your\nunsolicited essay on why Gremlins\nis actually about suburban white\nfear of Black culture.\nSAM\nThe Gremlins are loud, talk in\nslang, are addicted to fried\nchicken and freak out when you get\ntheir hair wet.\n27.\nPRESIDENT BODKIN\nMy only problem with your movie is\nthat it was late. The silent\nprojects were last semester Sam.\nYou were supposed to have emailed\nyour sound treatment over Summer.\nSAM\nI’ve been getting footage.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nThis is your senior thesis Sam,\nwhere the hell is your head at?\nSAM\nI’ve got Radio, BSU, this Head of\nHouse thing --\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\n-- Do you want this? Cause if not,\ndon’t waste my time here --\nSam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel.\nSAM\n-- Look this thing might as well be\nmy right hand Professor. I was busy\nthis summer that’s all.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nWith everything but your major?\nWhile your peers are taking\ninternships, making short films...\nSAM\nMy dad. He’s sick. Had to go home.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nIf you need some time off, take it.\nBut if you want to make it to next\nsemester --\nSAM\n-- I do --\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\n-- Pull it together. This is\nManchester.\nSam wants this. It’s in her eyes as she holds her tongue.\n25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25\nSam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys.\n28.\nSAM\nThematically dubious?\nGABE\nWell what was that supposed to be\nabout exactly?\nSAM\nYou’re thematically dubious!\nGabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nSince when do TA’s give critiques?\nGABE\nYou invoke Minstrelsy for shock\nvalue, but to what end?\nSAM\nTo invoke the same feeling I get\nwhen I turn on the TV and see some\nso-called reality star shuck and\njive for ratings egged on by no\ndoubt white producers. Or the sassy\nBlack secretary with no backstory\nor character development aside from\ntheir skin color.\nGABE\nSo it’s a tit for tat? *\nEXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY *\nSAM *\nYou’re honestly saying that art *\ncan’t be reactionary? *\nGABE *\nYou’re reacting to a work made *\nalmost a hundred years ago. *\nSAM *\nYes because fear of Black men being *\ninvolved in the United States *\nGovernment is a completely *\nantiquated concept. No social *\nrelevance whatsoever today. *\nGABE *\nFrankly I just think sometimes its *\nbetter to hold a mirror up to your *\naudience than to drop an *\nideological piano over their head. *\n29.\nSAM *\nFrankly I just think works that *\ndeal with the African Diaspora *\nthrough a post-modern lens are *\noutright rejected unless they’re *\nhandled by a white artist. *\nGABE *\nAfrican Diaspora? Really? *\n26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26\nThe war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs.\nSAM\nBlackface is alive and well in our\nculture. Who primarily buys hip\nhop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta?\nThe same homogenized images of\nBlack people over and over again?\nWhite people Gabe.\nGABE\nWho goes to see Tyler Perry movies?\nSAM\nWe’re an underfed community. None\nof this changes the fact that the\nvibrancy, the complexity of Black\nculture has been distilled into\ncommodities and marketing schemes\nto be bought and sold--\nGABE\n--to the detriment of the so called\n“real thing.” Got it.\nAnd into a room...\nINT. GABE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nGabe slams the door.\nSAM\nI am indistinguishable from the so\ncalled “urban” images used to amuse\nand market to white America.\nGABE\nAnd the commodification of culture\nis uniquely oppressive to Black\npeople?\n30.\nSam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans.\nGABE (CONT’D)\nSo when Kanye raps about Louis V\nand Rolexes and Classical Art,\nexactly what exploited pocket of\nBlack America are those references\nbeing mined from?\nSam can’t get her shirt off fast enough.\nSAM\nOn your knees.\nGabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy.\nCUT TO BLACK.\n27A INT. GABE’S ROOM - EVENING 27A\nSam’s eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips.\nShe’s surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the\noutside spoon. They’re both naked. Her pompadour frayed.\nGABE\nWhat? You dream in “Cosby” again?\nSAM\nMy hair was so straight. My sweater\nso big. I told you about that?\nSam’s phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie’s photo pop\nup. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn’t\nanswer. Silence as it hits her voicemail.\nGABE\nHey so...this whole “Head of House”\nthing. Congrats?\nSAM\nYeah, it's…it's.\nGABE\nWeird, right? Never took you as a\nstudent politician...\nReggie’s photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam’s eyes.\nSAM\nYeah, well...\nSam rolls out of bed. Gabe thinks twice before he asks it.\n31.\nGABE\nSam? What are we doing?\nShe badly wants to give him the answer he wants. Instead...\nSAM\nFucking.\n28 INT.

Get the honeys in here.\nGORDON\n“The honeys?” You’re from Vermont.\nKURT\nGuys what’s the Pastiche motto?\nGORDON\n“Sharpen thy sword.”\n33.\nMITCH\nOur motto is a euphemism for\nmasturbation?\nGORDON\nIt’s a reminder that satire is the\nweapon of reason. So who on campus\nis being unreasonable?\nMITCH\nSounds like a reminder of how gay\nyou are.\nGORDON\nWas that even a reasonable attempt\nat a quip Mitch?\nMITCH\nHey Gordon, say reasonable again.\nSAM (O.S.)\nDear White People, knowing Lil’\nWayne lyrics no longer earns you an\nHonorary Black Card. It just\nreminds me how often you say the\nword “nigga” when no one Black is\naround as is required in reciting\nsaid lyrics.\nKurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs\nheadphones into his computer and looks down.\nKURT\nThe hell does Sam think she is?\nMITCH\nLike Spike Lee and Oprah had a\npissed off baby.\nKurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they’re leaning\ntowards the same idea.\nKURT\nCould we?\nGORDON\nHow?\nKurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.\nKURT\nHey Lionel.

Kurt unzips\nhis pants silently.\nKURT (CONT’D)\nDo you accept?\nLionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he\nstarts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly\nlooks in the other direction. Kurt’s friends crack up.\nGORDON\nPlease put that away.\nKURT\nYou got to talk to these people in\na language they’ll understand.\nLionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro.\nLIONEL\nPathetic.\nKURT\n(yelling)\nWherever he ships you off to, be\nsure to pack a sense of humor with\nyou, kay bro?\nLionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy”\nbook to a section called...\nSAM (V.O.)\nThe Paper Bag Tests.\nAs Lionel reads we swish pan to...\n30 DREAM DINER 30\n...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us.\nSUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST\nSAM\nThe Tip Test. You hit up Jelly’s\nfor a snack.

You are the\nDean of students aren’t you?\nThe two share an old and heated glare.\n37.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)\nThe Times has been watching us like\na hawk. Last thing we need is some\n“race war” on newspapers across the\ncountry. How do you think our donor\nbase will feel about that? Our fundraiser\nis four weeks away.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHow bad is this deficit of yours?\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nWorse. But let me tell you\nsomething. If this blows up any\nfurther? It’s on you Walter.

They watch “Dear White People - 1,378,480 views.”\n42A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 42A\nSAM\nSort of. Nose-jobs smooth their\nBlack edges and try to blend.\nCoco runs her fingers through her straight hair.\nGORDON\nYou seen this one?\nSAM (YOUTUBE)\nDear White People using Instagram.\nYou have an iPhone and go on hikes.\nI get it.\nCOCO\nUgh.\nGordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco.

She hovers over them.\nCOCO (YOUTUBE)\nMuffins. I hate to do it, but Imma\nhave to get real Black with you.\nCoco a bit embarrassed scans the view count.\nSAM\nA Nose-job’s worst fear is that\ntheir “Blackness” might cause a\nfuss or draw undue attention so\nthey apologize for it or use it to\nself deprecate.\nCOCO\nForty thousand views already?\nGORDON\nLooks like someone submitted you to\nBuzzfeed. Taking off...\nCoco leans over them and scrolls down.

Being Black\nas hell just cause.\nSam rolls her eyes.\nSUNGMI\nBut what about just being you?\nSAM\nLike I said...\n44 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 44\nLionel’s got the eyes of the Bullpen on him.

Yes. Yup.\n49.\nGEORGE\nWe’ve got a news item but there’s\nsomething bigger here. It’s a\nprofile piece on Armstrong / Parker\nand Sam White’s pseudo revolution.\nANNIE\nWhat’s the headline?\nLIONEL\nOutdated nationalist seeks purpose\nstarts race war?\nLionel’s joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it.\nThe image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES\nbefore Lionel briefly.\nGEORGE\nBeers in the corner. Bang out the\nnews item tonight and we’ll work on\nthe profile piece for next week.\nLionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open\ncomputers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and\nAnnie stare at Lionel expectantly.\nLIONEL\nWhat are you doing?\nANNIE\nAll Bugle staffer must freestyle.\nIt’s law.\nGEORGE\nYou want to be a staffer right?\nLIONEL\n(awkward)\nMy name is Lionel\nKind of like a lion\nKing of the jungle\nIndigenous to Africa...\nThe beat has long since stopped.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nSorry.\n45 INT.

I was just --\nKURT\n-- trying to get on my staff?\nTROY\nI never really thought about --\nKURT\n-- Bullshit. Game Night is where we\nmake our bids for the new staff.\nIt’s why everyone’s here. You were\npractically about to bust out a tap\ndance.\nTROY\nI’m a Poly Sci major man. I just\ncame to hang out.\nKURT\nMy staff likes you. A lot.\nTROY\nBut you don’t.\nKURT\nThis thing with you and Sof...\nTROY\nI’m good to her.\nKURT\nOur dad’s have been playing a game\nof chess off and on since 1972.\nTROY\nWhat and Sof is the White queen?\nKURT\nYou’re a pawn. And I think it’s\ntime you get off the board bro.\nTroy takes this in.\nKURT (CONT’D)\nHere’s the deal. Every year we\nthrow a party. The point is to mock\nthe self important and moronic\nentities of the campus. The way to\nget staffed is to write an invite\nfor the party.\n51.\n(MORE)\nOur invites are legendary, we make\nGawker, the Post, tons of blogs\nevery year. If your invite is the\none that goes out, you’re\nguaranteed a spot on the staff. The\nrunners up are voted on by the rest\nof us.\nTroy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance.\n45A LIVING ROOM 45A\nCoco turns back to her now enamored crowd. She’s in her\nelement with these boys at her feet.\nCOCO\nI just think having good hair and\ncarrying on with a degree of\nsophistication doesn’t make me a\ntraitor to the race.\nMITCH\nWant to know why they used to call\nme Black Mitch?\nGORDON\nAbsolutely not.\nCOCO\nNo one called you that.\nKITCHEN\nJust as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach...\nTROY\nOkay.

SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 46\nSungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam’s apartment as\nthe party winds down.\nSUNGMI\nHey, about the rally. You could\nstill get the permit anyway Sam and\ngo against the board. Most people\nconsider that political suicide\nthough.\nREGGIE\nWe got to rally Sam. Time is now.\nSAM\nUse your head Reggie. You think a\nrally is going to change things?\nREGGIE\nIt’ll do a hell of a lot more than\na radio show or views on Youtube.\nEveryone gets quiet. Sungmi takes this time to exit.\nREGGIE (CONT’D)\nLook, we got power Sam and it’s\ntime we used it. We earned it.\nSAM\nWe? I didn’t see you running for\nshit Reggie.\nThe Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. Sam waits a beat\nand rolls her eyes.\n47 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT 47\nSam walks after Reggie.\nREGGIE\nTired.\nSAM\nDon’t “one word” me.\nREGGIE\nWhy you got to snap at me all the\ntime? I’m around you like twenty\nfour seven.

You know how I feel\nabout you.\nSAM\nHow am I supposed to know how you\nfeel about me?\nREGGIE\nYou know what? Forgive me if I see\nsomething in you. Something\ninspiring. Something folks like me\ncan get behind.\nReggie puts his hands on Sam’s belt and pulls her in to a\nkiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie’s shoulder Sam sees...\n...Gabe look back at her. He’s heartbroken. She pretends not\nto be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.\nREGGIE (CONT’D)\nTell me you’ll set up the rally.\nSAM\nI’ll set up the rally.\n48 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 48\nKurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances.\nGORDON\nAre we sure about this?\nKURT\nIt’s ironic. Bold. And don’t tell\nme I’m the only one who thinks Sam\nWhite’s little movement needs to\nget cut down to size.\n54.\nAgreement Coco’s gaze. Uncertainty in Troy’s.\nKURT (CONT’D)\nLooks like you got your Hip Hop\nparty Mitch.\nMITCH\n‘Bout time. It’s going to be huge\nman, fucking epic.\nKurt holds back a smile.\nKURT\nBoys, we’ve got a lot more mingling\nto do. We’ll be in touch. And Troy?\nGet off the board bro.\nTroy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. Troy smiles,\ngoes to exit.\nTROY\nNice seeing you.\nCOCO\nWhere’s Sofia?\nTROY\nI have no idea.\nCOCO\nTrouble in paradise?\nTroy shrugs and heads to the party.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nFigures.\n(off Troy’s\nincredulousness)\nNothing. I’m sure you’ve got\nsomething else fair and petite\nand...fair lined up for that drink.\nTROY\nWhat’s that supposed to mean?\nCOCO\nIt’s fine. I’m not even really into\nBlack dudes anyway.\nTROY\nI’ll have you know I’m an equal\nopportunity employer, okay?\n55.\nCOCO\nAnd what kind of jobs are you\nhiring for mister?\nCoco’s stiletto rubs the side of Troy’s calf.\nTROY\nAren’t you and Sofia --\nCOCO\n-- I’m an accessory to Sofia. Can’t\never shake the feeling I’m an\nassignment for that Afro Studies\nMinor of hers.\nTroy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards\nthis dangerous and tempting creature before him.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nI’m sure you have no idea what I\nmean.\n49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49\nLionel and George walk through the campus at night. George\nwaves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House.\nLIONEL\nShe seems really cool.\nGeorge just smiles.\nGEORGE\nDid we go too far? You’re in\nArmstrong/Parker right?\nLIONEL\nNo. Garmin.\nGEORGE\nFancy.\nLIONEL\nGeorge I’m not exactly down with\nSam and I’m not in the BSU. I got\nkicked out of Armstrong / Parker\nsame as Kurt. But I’m going to\nwrite a good story, okay?\nGEORGE\nI hope so. I want a Bugle on your\nchest by the end of the month.\nLionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest.\n56.\nThey reach the front of Lionel’s house. George runs his hand\nthrough Lionel’s hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some\nother kids - trade glances.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nYour fro’s so gnarly.\nLIONEL\nI’m growing it out.\nGEORGE\nNight Lionel.\nLionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of\nMitch and company.\nMITCH\nParty’s not over.\nLIONEL\nI live here.\nMITCH\nSorry bro. Invitation only.\nLIONEL\nIt’s two in the morning.\nMitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.\nLionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He\nscrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.\nStarts an email.\n50 INT. TROY’S BEDROOM - MORNING 50\nTroy’s Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and\nbesides a bright pink thong.\nCoco’s pink painted finger nails travel through the creases\nof Troy’s immaculate abs.\nTROY\nCoco huh?\nCOCO\nColandrea doesn’t exactly pass the\nresume test, you know? I mean\ncouldn’t you fucking die? My\nparents should’ve just named me\nGhetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do\nyou...indulge?\nCoco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.\n57.\nTROY\nIt’s ten am.\nCoco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nI don’t mess with that stuff.\nCoco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.\nCOCO\nSure about that?\nTROY\nSure you don’t like Black guys?\nCOCO\nGirl like me is just a placeholder\nfor ya’ll at a place like this.\nTROY\nI’m not like that.\nCOCO\nI don’t think Sam would agree.\nTROY\nThat was different.\nCOCO\nNo it wasn’t. Poor thing, she was\nlight skin-ded and everything.\nTROY\nYo, it wasn’t like that alright?\nTroy’s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy’s.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nMy pops. He wanted me with\nFletcher’s daughter. They’ve been\nin competition ever since they went\nhere. Pops hates that Fletcher\nended up President and he got stuck\nas the Dean.\nCOCO\nSo your upbringing may have\nactually fucked you up more than\nmine? That’s hot.\nTroy laughs and takes the joint back.\n58.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nThe hell is the difference between\na Dean and a President anyway?\nTROY\nApparently four hundred years of\nunreconciled oppression.\nCOCO\nHe’s not going to like you running\nwith the Pastiche boys is he?\nTROY\nIf I even get tapped.\nCOCO\nYou will. And you should do it.\nThey all land somewhere big, some\nbefore they even graduate. I’ve\nseen you in front of a crowd Troy.\nI bet you could be famous.\nTROY\nThat what you want? To be famous?\nCOCO\nI want people to know my name.\nTROY\nWhich one?\nCoco’s phone buzzes with a message. It’s Kurt.\nCOCO\n(reading)\nWe want you. Come by Ellington\ntomorrow at eight.\n(to Troy)\nAnything?\nTroy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy’s\neyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nYou’re going to have to stand up to\nhim sooner or later Troy.\n52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52\nTroy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation\nmarks her pretty face.\nSOFIA\nYou said you loved me.\n59.\nTROY\nI like you a lot.\nSalt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.\nSOFIA\nWhat do you do in the bathroom?\nWhen you leave the shower running?\nWas it just to get away from me?\nTroy wagers his answer and decides to confess.\nTROY\nI smoke weed and write jokes.\nPuzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia\njust turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...\n...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before\nTroy turns to enter the house.\n53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53\nLionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He\nturns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other’s gaze.\nAs they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that\nthey’re headed in the same direction.\n53A UPSTAIRS 53A\nLionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it\nwith a key. Troy’s already at the door when he looks up and\nrealizes Lionel’s just entered his apartment.\n54 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54\nTROY\nThe hell are you doing?\nLIONEL & TROY\nThis is my apartment.\nTROY\nThe hell it is.\nLIONEL\nThe Dean said it was the only\nopening.\nTROY\nHead of House doesn’t share.\n60.\nLIONEL\nBut you’re not Head of House.\nStill stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door\nleaving Lionel alone in the living room.\n57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57\nLionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the\ndifferent cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past\nand shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.\nDREADS\nStay Black, my brother.\nLIONEL\nSure thing?\nLionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the\nentrance - suddenly chums. Troy’s getting good news and\ngladly shakes Kurt’s hand.\nKURT\nNeed your submission by Thursday.\nTROY\nYou got it bro.\nThe two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG\nin the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining\nhall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.\nKURT\nThe fuck?\nSam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her\nother support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.\nTROY\nYo!\nTroy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the\nhumiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.\nLionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the\nother side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam\nbriefly who shares the same smirk.\nHe realizes Sam’s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind\nhim at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.\nREGGIE\nFinally made it in.\n61.\nDREADS\nBeen moved around a lot right?\nCURLS\nYou must have been terrified when\nyou saw “Armstrong/Parker” written\non your moving assignment.\nLIONEL\nI was just finishing up.\nREGGIE\nDo Black people scare you?\nLIONEL\n(realizing its true)\nNo.\nREGGIE\nYou’re too scared to even ask\nanyone for a cut.\nLIONEL\nI’m growing it out.\nDREADS\nNo. I’m growing it out. You’re\nfostering an ecosystem.\nREGGIE\nHow come you don’t come to BSU?\nLIONEL\nI listen to Mumford and Sons and\nwatch Robert Altman movies. You\nhonestly think I’m Black enough for\nthe union?\nDREADS\nYo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha\nfucka goes in.\nCURLS\n(after a beat)\nWe’re not all homophobes you know.\nBlack folks?\nLionel’s eyes dart around. How did she know?\nDREADS\nI’m bumping Frank Ocean right now.\nI don’t give a fuck. Imma still eat\nat Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets\ngood as hell.\n62.\nLIONEL\nI’m late for class.\nREGGIE\nYou’re the “Black voice” of the\nBugle now. We’re just trying to\ndecide if you are friend or foe.\nReggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.\nSam’s on the front page with the headline “WHITE STUDENTS\nTOLD TO ‘GET OUT’ BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”\nREGGIE (CONT’D)\nWe got to protect our girl.\nReggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over\nsomething with Martin at another table.\nLIONEL\nI’m not on staff. Not until I make\ngood on my assignment, I’m just --\nREGGIE\n-- Assignment? What’s the story?\nLIONEL\nThey want me to do a profile piece\non Black culture at Manchester.\nREGGIE\nOf which you are so clearly an\nexpert.\nShame floods Lionel’s face.\nREGGIE (CONT’D)\nSo what’s harder man? Being Black\nenough for the Black kids or the\nwhite ones?\nLIONEL\nBeing neither.\nAnother GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This\ntime it’s for...\n...Gabe, who’s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...\nGABE\nSam! Really Sam?\nShe just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.\n63.\n58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58\nProfessor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students\nfill in essay questions. Sam’s eyes are glued to a window...\nOutside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and\nstart pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.\nSam’s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch\nthe time.\n59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A\nSam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.\nFrom behind her...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nRunning late.\nSam pauses and turns to see him.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)\nFor your little rally?\nSAM\nForget your sign Dean?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDo you honestly think this is in\nthe spirit of Armstrong / Parker\nhouse?\nSAM\nThe role of the counter culture is\nto wake up the mainstream to --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n-- I’ve got furniture older than\nyou. Counter culture? Is that what\nyou think this is? That show of\nyours?\nSAM\nWhat about my show?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYour show is racist.\nSAM\nBlack people can’t be racist.\nThe Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.\n64.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nPrejudice? Yes. But not racist.\nRacism describes a system of\ndisadvantage based on race. Black\npeople can’t be racist since they\ndon’t benefit from such a system.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDo you read the school papers?\nSAM\nIs the New York Times a school\npaper?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYour antics are making press Sam\nand press like this keeps men like\nPresident Fletcher up at night.\nSAM\nWarm milk?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHe’s building a file on you.\nSAM\nIt’s not my fault your son couldn’t\nbeat me in an election.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI’m sure it was hard growing up.\nWondering which side you fit into.\nFeeling like you have to\novercompensate perhaps?\nSAM\nIf that’s true, I’m not the only\none Dean.\nSam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank’s last words resonate\nmore than she’d like.\nGabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.\n59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B\nHuge canvas signs with the words “WHITES ONLY” are strewn\nabout the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.\nSam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the\nSUV.\n65.\nREGGIE\nThere you are! We supposed to start\nat noon.\nSAM\nI told you I had class.\nThere’s a vibration in Sam’s pocket. Her phone says “MOM.”\nShe cuts it off and picks up a “white’s only” sign.\nREGGIE\nThose are going up on Gillespie.\nGood right?\nSam shrugs in the affirmative but it’s too much. Reggie sees\na doubt in her eyes.\nREGGIE (CONT’D)\nYo. What’s that? You’re not getting\ncold feet are you?\nSAM\nNo. I mean how long do I have to\ntalk anyway?\nREGGIE\nYou’re kidding right? You’re sort\nof the keynote.\nSAM\nYeah but...you know I think the\nwhole Malcolm X thing is your lane\nReg. I’m just not --\nREGGIE\n-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab\na bullhorn. Turn it on.\nSam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse\nand comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to\nher phone. Sam checks: “IT’S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME”\nSam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe\nwho’s just happened upon the parking lot.\nGABE\nWhat is all this?\nSAM\n(on phone)\nHey. In the middle of--\n-- Okay. Okay. Okay.\n66.\nTears well up in Sam’s eyes as she shakes her head no and\nheads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.\nWhen Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted\nlook of indignation asks her what she’s doing.\nREGGIE\nSam?\nSam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie’s\nheart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.\nREGGIE (CONT’D)\nSam!\n60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60\nReggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam’s door.\nREGGIE\nYo, what the hell Sam?\n61 INT. SAM’S ROOM - DAY 61\nThe banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The\ntears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.\nGABE\nYou want me to tell them to go?\nSAM\nYou’re so tough.\nGABE\nI will.\nSAM\nI want you to wait until they’ve\ngone and then head home.\nGABE\nI’m trying to be here for you.\nSAM\nCan you be somewhere else for me?\n61A HALLWAY 61A\nREGGIE\nSam! I know you’re home.\n67.\n61B SAM’S ROOM 61B\nGABE\nWhat do you see in him?\nSAM\nThe only eligible single brother on\ncampus.\nGABE\nWow. Okay.\nSAM\nI get it. Your parents owned in\nHarlem or something? You watched\n“Do The Right Thing” in high school\nand you want to prove to the world\nyou’re down?\nGABE\nI want to be down? How long does it\ntake to get your hair like that?\nREGGIE (O.S.)\nSam. We want to talk.\nSAM\nReggie I will call you later damn!\n(to Gabe)\nYou don’t know what you’re talking\nabout. Girls like me--\nGABE\n--what? Have to pick a side? I’m\nsick of your tragic Mulatto\nbullshit Sam!\nSAM\nYou can’t say Mulatto.\nGABE\nMulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!\nMORE BANGING\nSAM\nWindow. Go out the window.\nGABE\nI’m sorry if I can’t be your Nubian\nprince on my Black horse ready to\ntake you back to fucking Zamunda!\n68.\nSAM\nThat’s not a real African country.\nGABE\nCan I please get some credit for a\nsolid “Coming to America”\nreference?\nSam tries not laugh at this.\nGABE (CONT’D)\nThis isn’t you Sam.\nSAM\nNo? And who am I?\nGABE\nYou’re this...girl...\nSAM\nPerceptive.\nGABE\nWho...likes to argue with me about\nevery fucking thing. And I hate it\nbecause we both know you’re smarter\nthan me. Your favorite director is\nBergman, but you tell people its\nSpike Lee. You love bebop, but\nyou’ve got a thing for Taylor\nSwift. I know because my Mac picks\nup your Mac’s library.\nSAM\nAnd I was so careful...\nGABE\nYou like to use phrases from the\nthirties and wear clothes from the\nfifties and hairstyles from the\nsixties. You like to watch me when\nyou think I’m sleeping. And trace\nthe outlines of my face.\nSam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.\nGABE (CONT’D)\nYou’re more “Banksy” than “Barack”\nbut you’ve been co-opted as some\nsort of revolutionary leader or\nsomething? But really you’re an\nanarchist. A beautiful writer,\nartist, filmmaker, shit starter.\nAnd beautiful, in general.\n69.\nSam’s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: “Mom.”\nSAM\nYeah? Yeah? Yeah. It’s okay. Get\nsome sleep.\nSam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE\nfrom Sam as she let’s go of the tension she’d been holding.\nGABE\nEverything okay?\nSAM\n(happy tears)\nHis condition’s stable.\nGABE\nGood. That’s good Sam.\nGabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.\nSAM\nGabe!\nGabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...\nGABE\nWhat!?\n...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down\nthe heartbroken looks on her disciples’ faces.\nSAM\nI’m sorry.\nAnd with that she closes the door right on Reggie.\n62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62\nCoco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing\nterrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee’s.\nHELMUT\nNew videos are picking up steam.\nCOCO\nTold you I was good TV.\nHELMUT\nThe show I’m scouting for... It’s\ncalled Black Face / White Place.\nIt’s reality. Like a “True Life.”\nEach episode centers on a different\none of “us” in a sea of “them.”\n70.\nCOCO\nInteresting.\nHELMUT\nInteresting? You think they want\ninteresting? Dignified stories of\ntriumph and survival?\n(off Coco’s naive shrug)\nThey want the “authentic urban\nexperience” which is basically\nnetwork talk for bitching and weave\nsnatching. I’m telling you this\nbecause the network is looking to\ntake one of the subjects to series.\nI got one episode. One shot to find\nthat subject. So if we do this...\nCOCO\n...we do it all the way. I’m\nguessing Sam turned you down.\nHELMUT\nI think so. She called me a\nBojangling Oofta, whatever that\nmeans. Everything else she said\nwould’ve been bleeped on tv.\n(off Coco’s laugh)\nSo look, forty thousand hits on\nYoutube is good. It’s not great.\nCOCO\nI’m about to get a whole lot more.\n63 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - DAY 63\nCoco sits before a video camera. The room is dim.\nKURT\nWe don’t have anyone like you on\nstaff and you had a great idea. We\nbrought you here to --\nCOCO\n-- I want to MC it. Your party.\nKURT\nWe’re here to tell you what we\nwant.\nCOCO\nYou want me and in order to get me,\nyou have to let me MC.\n71.\n(MORE)\nAnd I want to do a live video blog\nfrom my Youtube account.\nBACK TO:\n64 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 64\nHELMUT\nThey’d let you do that?\nCOCO\nThey got no choice. They need me --\nBACK TO:\n65 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65\nCOCO\n-- cause without me ya’ll look like\na bunch of privileged assholes.\nKURT\nWe don’t let people video blog our\nevents...\nCOCO\n...You got a week to put this thing\ntogether boo boo. What’s it going\nto be?\nCUT TO:\n66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66\nHelmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye.\nCOCO\nYou look surprised.\nHELMUT\nIt’s just...\n67 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67\nTroy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in\ntheir rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. They\neach look at the other in alternate intervals.\nHELMUT (V.O.)\n...not everyone is as camera ready\nas you.\n67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A\n72.\nCOCO (CONT'D)\nLionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on\nhis TV and heads to...\n67B KITCHEN 67B\n...bar divide. Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy’s\nroom. He’s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels\nLionel’s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.\n67C TROY’S ROOM 67C\nTroy types in “KURT FLETCHER” in the “To” field and “PASTICHE\nSUBMISSION” in the subject field. He hits “send” and swallows\nthe lump in his throat.\n68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68\nTroy gingerly enters into the Dean’s office. Martin and Dean\nFairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMartin, would you share with Troy\nwhat you shared with me?\nMARTIN\nThe server that processes the\nvoting results for House Elections\nhas shut down the A.P. database.\nSaw it this morning. Apparently the\nintermediary program is on a\nrefractile loop.\nTROY\nI’m a Poly Sci major man.\nMARTIN\nSam currently has 445 votes. That’s\n200 more than she had last week\nduring the actual election.\nTROY\nThere’s not even that many\nresidents in Armstrong / Parker.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nShe cheated. Hacked the system.\n69 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY 69\nSam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the\nDean’s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.\n73.\nSAM\nI wouldn’t even begin to know how\nto do something like that.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nIs your little war really this\nimportant?\nSam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)\nI understand the pressure to stand\nfor something at an institution\nlike this but you’re barking up the\nwrong tree okay?\n70 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70\nMARTIN\nHad to have been Reggie. Dude’s in\nmy programing class. Good. Just\nforgot to turn his program off.\nTROY\nWow.\nMARTIN\nYou’re the rightful Head of House.\nTROY\n(shit)\nSo great.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMartin, let me talk to Troy for a\nbit. I appreciate this.\n71 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71\nSam glares at Fletcher.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nYour advisor tells me you’re\nhanging on by a thread in you\nmajor. Perhaps it’s time to\nreprioritize.\nSAM\nYou’re trying to frighten me, but I\nthink you’re the one who’s scared.\n74.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nAnd I think you long for the days\nwhere Blacks were hanging from\ntrees and denied actual rights.\nThen you’d actually have something\nto fight against.\nA swell of emotion behind Sam’s steel eyes.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)\nYou will be facing two hearings in\nthe coming weeks that could end in\neither Probation or Suspension. One\non the merits of your show, the\nother on your election to Head of\nHouse.\nSam is truly scared by this.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)\nYour responsibilities to your house\nare suspended. Your show is done\nfor. And another one of your\nillegal “demonstrations” will only\nmake matters worse. This is a\ncritical time for this school.\nSAM\nYou damn right it is.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nWe don’t have an intolerance\nproblem here. Except for the one\nI’m looking at.\n72 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 72\nTroy and his father are alone.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou didn’t tell me you and Sofia\nhad a misunderstanding.\nTROY\nWho did?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHer father. She was very upset.\n(off Troy’s silence)\nTroy. What sort of vision do you\nhave for yourself?\n75.\nTROY\nGet my degree. Then Law School and\nthen --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n--And what’s that got to do with\npartying with Kurt? With smoking\nweed and writing jokes?\nPanic flashes over Troy.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)\nOkay, so what? Is it the spotlight\nKurt gets? You want to be on...tv\nor something? You know how many\nBlack men waste their lives to get\non TV? Be rappers and ball players?\nTROY\n(wanting it to be true)\nDad no. I want what we always\ntalked about. Maybe have my own\nfirm someday? Run for office. Make\na difference. Wife. Kids. I want\nall that. I really really do.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAnd the drugs? God damn it Troy I\ntaught you better than this. I have\nbeen in academia a long time, I’ve\nseen a lot of things. The men who\nreally run this world? You got no\nidea what they see when they see\nyou. You are not going to be what\nthey all think you are. You will\nnot give them that satisfaction,\nyou hear me?\nTROY\nYes sir.\n73 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73\nSam steps out of Fletcher’s office into the waiting room.\nKurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other\ndown as Kurt enters his father’s office.\nA SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit\nthe room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through\nthe window.\nSam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and\nlistens in.\n76.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nI know about the party. You picked\na hell of a time.\nKURT\nWhat party --\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\n-- You’re cancelling Kurt. End of\nstory.\n75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75\nLionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over\nhears...\nGEORGE (O.S.)\nLionel’s story on the would-be\nprotest outside of Gillespie is\nrunning tomorrow and I’m also\nhaving Lionel work on a profile\npiece of Armstrong/Parker like you\nsuggested. Really break down what’s\ngoing on.\nLionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a\nphone call.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nRight. It’s almost like they\nrecycle so much from their past -\nMusic, food, fashion, and now\nturbulence.\nThis leaves a bitter taste in Lionel’s mouth.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nThank you so much. Okay, take care.\nGeorge can’t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.\nANNIE\nWell?\nGEORGE\nThat was our Times advisor. He said\nit’s stories like these that get\neditors recommendation letters.\nLionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but\nreassured when they see who it is.\n77.\nLIONEL\nThe Negro at the door didn’t scare\nyou this time.\nAnnie smiles and heads for the door.\nANNIE\nLionel please. You’re only\ntechnically Black. G, going to\nFrench. You want me to hold your\nseat?\nGEORGE\nThanks.\nAnnie smiles and walks out.\nLIONEL\nYou need something? Saw your email.\nGEORGE\nYeah, I need someone to do the\nDonor’s function on Saturday. Small\ndinner for the school’s big givers.\nAdministration wants a little\ncoverage.\nLIONEL\nThat’s Halloween night.\nGEORGE\nRight, which is why no one else\nwill take it.\nLIONEL\nAh. Thus the new guy.\nGeorge gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets\nclose.\nGEORGE\nOn my way to class, but you can\nstay and check out last year’s\npiece. You’ll do fine.\nLIONEL\nI don’t know. Are there going to be\nany racially fueled outbursts at\nthis thing?\nGEORGE\nNever know right?\n78.\nIt’s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.\nLIONEL\nAm I a good writer?\nGEORGE\nYou’ll get better. And we need you\nright now.\nLIONEL\nYou’re just a big recommendation\naway from landing the Times.\nGEORGE\nGod I hope so.\nLionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nHey.\n-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So\ninstead he just kisses him.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nI’m glad we finally got that Bugle\non your chest.\nLionel’s all mixed up.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nThere’s a big party the night of\nthe Donor’s event. Call me after,\nmaybe we can hang?\nLIONEL\nYeah. Sounds good.\nGeorge heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed.\n76 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76\nTroy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag\nto reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He’s getting\nready for something.\nHis phone buzzes with a notification: “Message from:\nPASTICHE”\nTroy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...\n79.\nKURT (V.O.)\nDear White People. Are you tired of\nyour hum drum, Wonderbread\nexistence of accidental racism and\nwishing you could sip on Henny out\nyo crunk cup without a Bitch giving\nyou the side-eye? Course you are.\nMONTAGE:\nAs our subjects get ready for their evening.\nTroy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and\ncorrecting imperceptible imperfections.\nKURT (V.O.)\nFor all those looking to unleash\ntheir inner Negro from years of\nbondage and oppression Pastiche\nproudly presents “Dear White\nPeople” our 89th annual Hallow’s\nEve Costume Party - tonight at 10\nPacific Time or 5 Colored People\nTime. Sorry for the short notice,\nbut let’s keep it one hun-ed.\nYou’ve had us on your calendar for\nweeks.\n76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A\ncombing out his unwieldy fro. He flinches in pain as he\nfluffs out each section.\nKURT (V.O.)\nDudes must rock FUBU, Ecko,\nRocawear, or Sean John. XXXL is the\nsmallest size T-Shirt you can wear,\npreferably with a collage of Barack\nObama and Tupac on it. Stunner\nShades, chains, and Blue-Tooth\ndevices sticking out yo ears are\nalso encouraged.\n76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B\nsmooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with\nfoundation. She begins on her eyes.\nKURT (V.O.)\nLadies, we need to see huge hoop\nearrings, long nails, and cheap\ntight clothes.\n80.\n(MORE)\nA proper hood rat starts fights,\nspeaks loudly, and when she can’t\nthink of the word she’s trying to\nsay just makes one up, such as\n“edumicated.” Feel free to fry up\nsome chicken, bring Kool-Aid,\nWatermelon, 40s, Henny, and of\ncourse Dat Purple Drank. No bougie\nbitches allowed.\n76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C\nup her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around\nher ears. She takes in her image in the mirror.\nKURT (V.O.)\nNaturally there will be a freestyle\nrap competition so bring it, get yo\nshine on and join us for the party\nof the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga\nNigga Nigga. Boy that felt good.\n77 EXT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 77\nLaughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside\nwhile Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the\nentrance. He smokes on Coco’s one-hitter from before.\nLionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.\nThe two are surprised to see each other.\nLIONEL\nFunny seeing you here.\nTROY\nFather likes to show me off at all\nthe Donor functions. The dessert\ncourse is usually my cue to take a\nbreather while they talk shop.\n(friendlier)\nThe trick is to dazzle them into\nforking over their estates just\nbefore they kick the bucket.\nLionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.\nLIONEL\nSo...Picard or Kirk?\nTROY\nKirk. Wait...\nLIONEL\nI saw you watching Star --\n81.\nKURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nTROY\n-- Yo what happens in the crib\nstays in the crib. Not trying to\nget my card revoked.\nLIONEL\nHey, some could argue that a show\nwith Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn\nand Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty\nBlack show.\nTROY\nYeah? That work out for you?\nLIONEL\nNo. No it did not. At least not in\nHigh School. I bet there’s a statue\nof you at your High School.\nTROY\nI was beloved. Won’t lie.\nLIONEL\nDid they know you were a trekker?\nTROY\nMy pops left a paint by numbers\ntemplate for success at that High\nSchool. All I had to do was fill in\nthe blanks. Football captain.\nValedictorian. Prom King.\nLionel sees a sadness in Troy.\nTROY (CONT’D)\nSo what? You’re growing that out?\nLIONEL\nI think it’s gaining sentience.\nTROY\nIt’s...out there.\nLIONEL\nIt’s like a black hole for white\npeople’s fingers. They’re obsessed.\nTROY\nYou know I cut hair. Why didn’t you\nask me?\nLIONEL\nYou’re I dunno...you?\n82.\nBehind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to\nGillespie.\nGEORGE\nLi! You ready man?\nLIONEL\nNo costumes? I got a tux for this.\nANNIE\nWe just got out of the staff room.\nGEORGE\nYeah, we’re going as overworked.\nLIONEL\nWhere is it?\nANNIE\nGarmin House. On third I think?\nLIONEL\nThird and Basin. I know it.\nBefore Lionel jets to join them.\nTROY\nYo man. If I’d gone to your High\nSchool, I’d have had your back.\nLionel smiles and heads after his new friends.\n78 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 78\nLionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos\nof a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.\n79 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 79\nThe party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in\ncostume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as\npimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack\nObama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.\nIt’s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with\n“Purple Drank.” Everyone downs the stuff.\nINT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT\nTroy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.\nTROY\n...my own firm. Maybe run for\noffice. Make a difference you know?\n83.\nThe couple smile. A buzz draws Troy’s eyes to his phone -\nphotos from “Dear White People” pop up in his news feed.\n80 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 80\nLionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously\nput up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel\nglances at the posters - it’s Kurt with a large Afro wig\nmimicking Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyers.\nLIONEL\nThis is kind of fucked up. Right?\nGEORGE\nPastiche. The world’s most erudite\nboneheads. Who wants another round?\nCome on Lionel, help a brother out.\nLIONEL\nKitchen’s this way.\n80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A\nCoco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She’s\nfeeling herself as she’s handed a drink.\nShe’s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a\nparty. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.\nHer confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath\nher party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...\nCOCO\nHey there muffins. How do I look?\nWhy are white folks so obsessed\nwith being Black? And why are Black\nfolks so addicted to Blonde Barbie\ndoll weaves? Honeys it’s a strange\nsymbiosis we’re here to explore...\nCoco’s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her\niPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.\n80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B\nLionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the\nkitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...\n80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C\n...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales\nLionel’s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel’s hair.\n84.\nLIONEL\nOuch.\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nLIONEL\nIt’s okay. Can’t wait to cut all\nthis off.\nGEORGE\nDon’t you dare.\nGeorge plunges his fingers into Lionel’s fro once again.\nPulls a touch too hard.\nGEORGE (CONT’D)\nI could eat you like a Hershey’s.\nThis sets something off in Lionel.\nLIONEL\nI’ll be right back.\nLionel breaks George’s grasp and heads out the bathroom...\nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n...and back out into the party. He’s trapped in a nightmare\nof caricatures and reveling students. Can’t breathe.\nEXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT\nLionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his\nhead as he starts walking away from the party.\nJust then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some\nfriends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.\nKURT\nWhat the hell?\n81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81\nLionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the\ndining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.\nDINING HALL\nSAM\nFor a genius dude you’re a fucking\nidiot.\n85.\nREGGIE\nI did it, we did it for you.\nSAM\nI didn’t ask for it Reggie. I look\nlike I betrayed this house.\nREGGIE\nYeah? Well you betrayed me.\nSam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.\nLIONEL\nSam? Can we talk?\nSam turns back around fiercely.\n82 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 82\nA turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED\nLIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.\nThe crowd starts to get live now.\nCoco continues to make her way through the party - her face\nvisibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She\ncontinues out back...\n83 EXT. KURT’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83\n...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a\nlong straight Black wig and brag to friends...\nANNIE\nHey who am I? “Bitch it’s weave.\nNoun. Present tense ho!”\nRight in the gut. She’s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...\n84 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84\nKurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give\nhim props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the\nothers. His phone rings.\nKURT\nYeah?\nINTERCUT\nCOCO\nKurt, it’s me. I can’t do this.\n86.\nKURT\nOkay, I’m fucking confused.\n85 INT. SAM’S ROOM - NIGHT 85\nLionel sits across from Sam.\nSAM\nWhat do you want me to do? Go over\nthere and yell at them?\nLIONEL\nHave you heard you yelling?\nSAM\nThis house is filled with folks\nwilling to take up after a cause\nLionel. Believe me. Never would\nhave guessed you’d be one of them\nbut...\nLIONEL\nFor the first time in my life, I\ncan’t just sit around and do\nnothing. How can you?\nSAM\nIf I’m caught being a part of\nanything like this...it wouldn’t be\ngood for me right now okay?\nLionel gets up and walks towards the door.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nI’m done being everybody’s angry\nBlack chick.\nSam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.\nSam’s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and\nthen to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.\n86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86\nLionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining\nroom - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other\nstudents mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.\n86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A\nLionel gingerly walks in the room. He’s still an outsider\nhere - but something’s changed in him.\n87.\nLIONEL\nHey. How’s it going. Hi.\nNo one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.\nLionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nHey...what is this?\nSUNGMI\nBlack Student Union.\nLionel smiles shyly. He should’ve known that.\nReggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.\nDREADS\nYour call then man.\nREGGIE\n(to everyone)\nAlright ya’ll - thanks for coming\nout tonight. Looks like Sam’s not\nmaking it so...let’s just call it.\nThe crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and\nleave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...\nLIONEL\nUh. Excuse me. Hi. I’m Lionel. Some\nof you...none of you probably know\nme. I’ve never been to a meeting.\nBut I just came back from a party\non campus and I think you should\nknow about it.\nLionel’s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He’s got the\njudging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an\nopen laptop on a desk.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nAnybody mind if I?\nReggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up\nthe party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel\nbrowses through the photos.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nI mean...I don’t know. This is\nfucked up right?\nREGGIE\nAlright brother. What’s the plan?\n88.\nLionel realizes the eyes aren’t judging. They’re mobilizing.\nReadying for action. Lionel steels himself.\nLIONEL\nWe go over there. Now.\nCURLS\nThink there’s enough of us?\nSUNGMI\nYou know you don’t have a monopoly\non being a pissed off minority.\nLatino’s United is meeting across\nthe hall. Asian American League\ntoo.\n(off the stares)\nYou guys got better snacks.\n87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87\nTroy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads\nfrom the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.\nShoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table\ncovered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to\nhis father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President\nFletcher.\nTROY\nDad...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNot now Troy.\nTROY\nIt’s important. There’s something\nhappening on campus. I might’ve...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou’re being rude son.\nDean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--\nTROY\nOh am I? How about I tell your\nprecious donors and anyone here\nwho’ll listen about the kind of a\nschool it is they’re giving to?\nThe Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on\nhim - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.\n89.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI don’t know who you think you are\nyoung man but you don’t get to talk\nto your father any kind of way.\nTROY\nAll I say to you is yes sir and no\nsir! Look I should’ve brought this\nup before but --\n(off Fairbanks dismissal)\n-- listen to me!\nDean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.\n88 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88\nKurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.\nKURT\nWhat?\nGORDON\nYeah dude. We all got it. I mean,\neverything’s cool right?\nA noise in the other room startles them...\n88A LIVING ROOM 88A\n...It’s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues\nwith a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid’s face. The\nparty swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.\nA SMASH yanks Kurt’s attention back to the kitchen...\n88B KITCHEN 88B\n...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.\nKURT\nLionel?\nKurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.\nKURT (CONT’D)\nThe fuck you think you’re doing\nman?\nLionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids\nflood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.\nKURT (CONT’D)\nThat all you got?\n90.\nLIONEL\nWe’re putting an end to this Kurt.\nKURT\nFuck you I’m calling the cops.\nMARTIN\nHalf of this crowd is under 21.\nA loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the\nLiving Room.\n88C LIVING ROOM 88C\nMitch has taken over the mic.\nMITCH\nGimme that mic\nBefore I slap ya\nLooking for some dykes,\nthat wanna another chapta.\nIf you do me slow,\nyou can do me faster,\nI’ll pass you to the Nigga on my\nright, he gets you after.\nLIONEL\nKurt--\nKURT\n-- Why don’t you tuck your tail\nbetween your legs, run and tell the\nDean and get the fuck out.\nLionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU\nwatches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.\nLionel turns to go and spots...\n...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right\nbehind George is...\n...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed\nat the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.\nLionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.\nLionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of\none of the rapper’s hands.\nLIONEL\nHeyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!\n91.\nThe crowd is with it - thinks it’s part of the show as Lionel\nproceeds to freestyle terribly...\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nMy name is Lionel,\nSome people call me Li.\nLots of people think\nthat I talk kinda white.\nWell that’s alright.\nYeah that’s cool.\nI’d rather you think I’m white,\nthan tap dance for you.\nWith that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He\nthen takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.\nSparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.\nLionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.\nLionel’s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes\nKurt away in his defense.\nGordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.\nMore equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the\nparty disintegrates into chaos.\nSam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.\nArt is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on\nthe ground. Arguments come to physical blows.\nThe steel in Sam’s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?\nAnd then she spots...\n...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.\nSam’s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.\nCOCO\nWhat? Say it. Come on.\nSam stays silent.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nThis may come as a shock, but these\npeople don’t give a fuck about no\nHarriet muthafuckin Tubman. They\npay millions of dollars on their\ntans, their lips, their asses, Jay-\nZ tickets, you name it, cause they\nwanna be us.\n92.\n(MORE)\nSo they got to be for a night.I’m\nnot about to go out into the\nstreets in protest of a Halloween\nparty.\nSam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco\nrealizes it’s herself she’s trying to convince.\nCoco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is\nnew for her. Keeping her mouth shut.\n89 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 89\nCoco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her\nlashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.\n90 EXT. KURT’S YARD - NIGHT 90\nKurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the\nground.\nKURT\nDude. I know you can’t help it...\nLionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.\nKURT (CONT’D)\n...but why are you such a fag dude?\nLionel spits in Kurt’s face and pops right back up again. We\nsee it in his eyes - he’ll never give up.\nKurt’s hand is on Lionel’s collar. He pushes him down again.\nKids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -\nsome from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.\nLionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt’s eyes.\nLionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.\nLIONEL\nFinally got me where you want me.\nKurt’s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.\nLionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as\nwell. No time to soak this in though. Kurt’s let up. For a\nmoment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the\nface. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.\nThe shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.\nThe world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort\nof makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.\n93.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nKids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -\nOne is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a\ncouple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.\n91 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 91\nThe motor on Sam’s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a\ncomplete standstill.\nTroy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact\nwith Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.\nDean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos.\nSam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWhat is all this?\n92 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92\nA SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN\nWe see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.\nCUT TO:\n92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A\nparty. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.\nWindows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the\nlawn. Ash where fires were put out.\nKURT\nI didn’t do this. Sam. I had\nnothing to do with this.\nCUT TO:\n92B MORNING NEWS 92B\nANCHOR\nWhat some are calling a “race war”\nhas erupted at one of the nation’s\noldest and most prestigious --\nCUT TO:\n92 GILLESPIE FORUM now filled with students who sit before 92\nDean Fairbanks and President Fletcher for a Town Hall.\nEveryone wears a look of outrage.\n94.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWe don’t condone this egregious\nevent and are investigating its\norigins. The president and I are\nlooking at ways to address issues\nof Diversity at Manchester.\nREGGIE\nHOUSING REFORM!\nApplause breaks out amongst the crowd. But so do boos.\nCUT TO:\n93 VARIOUS SPOTS AROUND CAMPUS. Students address the camera. 93\nMITCH\nI’m sorry but it’s bullshit. Yo\nthis is how we get down. If you\ncan’t take a joke in this day and\nage? The fact we can joke about it\nproves we’ve moved on you feel me?\nThis is an attack on free speech!\nWe’re the victims here!\nCUT TO:\n93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A\nof Armstrong / Parker where Lionel address the camera...\nLIONEL\nIt’s hard enough for us to even get\ninto a school like this. Let alone\nsucceed. Find our way. This is only\na debate because of who Kurt’s dad\nis, which just proves the point.\nAll you did was have a radio show\nand look what happened to you.\nCUT TO:\n93B COCO as she talks directly to camera. 93B\nCOCO\nI know this may come as a shock,\nbut nobody gives a fuck about no\nHarriet muthafuckin Tubman...they\nwanna be us. So they got to be for\na night.\nCUT TO:\n95.\n93C A POSTER featuring Troy rendered like the famous Shepard 93C\nFairy Obama posters with the words “A NEW HOPE” written at\nthe bottom as well as “TROY BROUSSARD FOR PRESIDENT.” This\ngets some more applause from the crowd watching.\nTROY\nOf course I got my dad involved. It\nwas the right thing to do. I didn’t\nmean for all this to happen. All\nthe posters and everything.\nSAM (O.S.)\nBut you’d welcome it? A shot for\nschool president.\nTROY\nI think...I’d make more than few\npeople happy if I ran.\nCUT TO:\n93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. She 93D\nlingers.\nSAM (V.O.)\nEven though I’d been expressly\nforbidden to do so, I wanted to do\none last show. Something to sum up\nthe moment. To savor in the pop of\nthe post racial bubble just burst.\nSAM\nDear White People...\nSAM (V.O.)\nI wanted to react.\nSam takes in a thoughtful breath before...\nSAM\n...Know what? Nevermind.\nShe fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her\nheadpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in:\n“...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE”\nSam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on,\nwhen all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE. Sam turns to\nsee that the entire room is on it’s feet including Prof\nBodkin and Gabe.\n96.\n94 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 94\nDean Fairbanks loosens his tie, flanked by several SCHOOL\nOFFICIALS. They’ve been here for hours listening to...\nKURT\nOnce I heard what the group was\nplanning, I sent out an email to\nthe staff to cancel it. You have\nthe email printed in front of you.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWho’s this?\nKurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him.\nKURT\nMy lawyer.\nCUT TO:\n94B We’ll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B\nCOCO\nSo when I got the invite and saw\neveryone clicking “yes” I figured\nit was back on.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou were hoping to make the staff?\nCOCO\n...\nCUT TO:\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAt what point in time did you show\nup to the event?\n94C Sam sits with arms folded. 94C\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)\nSamantha.

Troy is silent and anxious.9 4D\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n(reading)\n“...wishing you could sip on Henny\nout yo crunk cup without a Bitch\ngiving you the side-eye?”\n(and then)\nYou write this Troy?\nTroy looks up at his father embarrassed.\nTROY\nNo. Mine wasn’t chosen.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nBut you wanted to be?\nTROY\nWhat I wanted didn’t matter then.\nWhy should it matter now? I told\nyou about the party, remember?\nCUT TO:\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94\nFacebook account.\nKURT\nI loathe Facebook.\nAn OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear.\nKURT (CONT’D)\nYou’ve got to believe me.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou’ve used that line on me before\nthis year Mr. Fletcher. When a\nhomophobic message mysteriously\nappeared on a voice mail line you\nshared with a roommate.\nCUT TO:\n98.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)\nWhat were your intentions when you\nwent back the second time?\nLIONEL\nTo stop it.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nBy any means necessary?\nLIONEL\nSomeone once told me...Manchester\nis like jazz. I don’t know much\nabout jazz. But from what I can\ntell, when your solo’s up, you\nbetter blow.\nFairbanks fights a smile.\nCUT TO:\n94C SAM 94C\nAll I did that night was hit record\nbrother.\nThe Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and\nlooks out his huge windows onto the campus below.\nCUT TO:\n94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials 94E\nare taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day.\nThe Dean tries a few passwords.\nCUT TO:\n94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C\nWant to hear something strange?\nThe Dean turns from the window.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)\nThe Pastiche group page hadn’t been\nused for months, until the invite\nwent out.\nCUT TO:\n94E The Dean tries a different password. Still invalid. 94E\nCUT TO:\n99.\n94C SAM 94C\nFascinating.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWell what’s interesting is how easy\nit was to access the group before\nthe note was sent. The password was\n“Pa$tiche” spelled with a dollar\nsign according to Kurt. Seems\nrecently it’s been changed.\nCUT TO:\n94E The Dean tries one more. It works. 94E\nCUT TO:\n94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D) 94C\nCouldn’t figure it out at first.\nThen I thought to try something.\nFive, seven, eight, three, five,\ntwenty six, one, nine, four, six.\nEleven numbers. Just like our\nstudent ID numbers. Just like your\nstudent ID number.\nSAM\nAs much as you hate him, you will\nstop at nothing to protect your\nmaster and his boy.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDid you send out the invite Sam?\nSAM\nThat invite, whoever sent it\nshould’ve been met with derision\nand outrage. Instead, a hundred\npeople showed up and they pulled\nout posters and decorations and\ncostumes they’d made for just such\nan occasion.\nSam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.\nSilence falls in the room. The Dean’s mind ticks.\n95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95\nA pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the\nheadline: “INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO\nEXPULSIONS MADE”\n100.\nNext to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT\nOBSERVER. The headline reads: “EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE\nHARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”\nGeorge picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...\n96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL’S APARTMENT - DAY 96\nLionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied\ngrin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.\nLIONEL\n2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless\ncomplex depictions of whites, white\nmen in particular exist - there\naren’t that many versions of us in\nthe culture.\nHis locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and\nfearless fro-hawk atop Lionel’s head.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nCulture has a powerful way of\ntelling people what they can and\ncan’t be. For people of color the\noptions are rather limited.\nTROY\nNext James Baldwin up in here. Wait\nhold on a sec.\nStar Trek is back from commercial break. Troy and Lionel\nwatch in silence.\n97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97\nGabe is just about finished with Lionel’s article too. Looks\nup just in time to see...\nGABE\nHello Sam.\nSam sneers at his formalities.\nGABE (CONT’D)\nRead about Armstrong / Parker.\nSAM\nYeah. Prez made an executive\nwithdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.\nGABE\nCongrats?\n101.\nSAM\n(with a shrug)\nGetting too dramatic man. Thinking\nabout getting an apartment off\ncampus. We’ll see.\nGABE\nSam going against the grain?\nShocked. How’s papa White?\nSAM\nHe’s recovering.\nGABE\nGood. Well...\nGabe fights the urge to hug her.\nSAM\nWe were actually on the phone last\nnight for hours. First time we\ntalked since the bypass. He was\nputting up a strong front. Teasing\nme about being so worried. Then\ncame the stories about me as a\nlittle girl I’d heard a thousand\ntimes. About how independent I was.\nGabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.\nGABE\nWant to talk about it?\nSAM\nMy mother worked nights so he would\ntake me to school. And it pissed me\noff because he would follow me all\nthe way to homeroom. Every time he\ntried to hold my hand I’d scream\nand pull away. He thought I was\njust being...difficult.\nA hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?\nSAM (CONT’D)\nBut it was the kids. And the\nparents and the teachers. They’d\nsee this Black girl and this white\nman and wonder what we were doing\ntogether. Even at nine I could feel\ntheir eyes on me. Especially at\nnine. It brought tears to my eyes.\nGabe’s stone face melts at this.\n102.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nI was just a bratty girl, didn’t\nknow any better but-- The thought\nof losing him-- You know? I just\nfeel so bad. How awful am I to do\nthat to him? To anyone I love?\nGabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His\narm is on her shoulder now.\nGABE\nI’m sure he forgives you.\nSAM\nThink so?\nGabe nods. Sam’s normal defenses come back up lest she cries.\nSAM (CONT’D)\nSo anyway. I didn’t mean to say all\nof that. I don’t know why I did.\nGABE\nSam. Where are you going?\nSAM\nI don’t know. Lunch?\nGabe starts to walk with her.\nGABE\nIsn’t it Mac and Cheese day at\nArmstrong/Parker?\nSAM\nThink they’ll let you in?\nGabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam\nlets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into\neach others’ eyes.\nDon’t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.\n98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98\nCoco sits across from Helmut. He’s got his eyes on a Youtube\nclip from Sam’s movie featuring Coco.\nCOCO (YOUTUBE)\nI know this may come as a shock,\nbut they don’t give a fuck about no\nHarriet muthafuckin Tubman...\n103.\nHELMUT\nTwo hundred thousand views. Look\nthey even auto-tuned it.\nWith a click Helmut pulls it up.\nAUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE)\nMuthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin\nTubman! Don’t give a fuck about no\nmuthafuckin Tubman!\nCoco’s not sure what to think.\nHELMUT\nCouple months, that’s how long\nshooting for an episode takes. We\nrecommend you cut your course load\nin half to accommodate the\nschedule.\nCOCO\nHalf?\nHELMUT\nTrust me it it’ll read “full-time”\nin the episode. If...once we go to\nseries, we might have to figure out\na summer schedule.\nCOCO\nFor shooting?\nHELMUT\nFor uh...classes and stuff. Won’t\nbe graduating early anymore\nsweetheart.\nHelmut shifts a contract over to Coco.\nHELMUT (CONT’D)\nFive grand for the episode. Twenty\neach if you get picked up for\nseries. What do you say?\nCoco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.\nHELMUT (CONT’D)\nTrust me sweetie it’s the same out\nthere as it is in here. Good news\nis? Against all that damn white you\nand I? We pop. Think I wanted to be\nthe go-to producer for all things\nBlack?\n104.\nCoco shrugs.\nHELMUT (CONT’D)\nTell you what’s worse though. Being\nthat broke Nigga stuck on the south\nside of Chicago. Hundred and\nFiftieth street.\nCoco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --\n99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99\nCoco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He’s flanked\nby his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other\nBoFros. They all carry Troy’s “New Hope” posters.\nCOCO\nMade some new friends?\nTroy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and\nshares a glance with Reggie, who doesn’t approve.\nCOCO (CONT’D)\nFine.\nTROY\nCome on Coco.\nCOCO\nFuck you.\nCoco starts to walk ahead.\nTROY\nMy dad saw your videos. He’s a\nlittle worried about --\nCOCO\n-- how it’ll look. With your\ncampaign and all. What’s your best\nfriend Reggie think?\nTroy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.\nTROY\nWe had fun, alright?\nCOCO\nI get everyone else wants you to\nwin Troy. But do you?\nTroy doesn’t know how to answer that. He stares at the\ntriumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.\n105.\nCoco’s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of\nwho she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.\nWatching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and\nSungmi. They both know that look well...\nSAM\nHey Lionel. With me out and Troy\nmoving on - A/P’s going to need a\nnew head of house.\nLIONEL\nThink there’s a story there? Who do\nyou think it’ll be?\nSam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.\nLIONEL (CONT’D)\nWhat? No.\nSUNGMI\nEveryone loves you. Won’t be hard\nto rally the vote.\nSAM\nYeah. We got you man.\nLionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.\n100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100\nFairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher’s office to join\nhim at his desk. They’re all ears as they look across to...\nHELMUT\nLet me get this straight. First you\ntried to break up the Black house.\nThen you took down the sister with\nthe little radio show. And after\nall that, your kid throws a\nBlackface party?\nFLETCHER\nNow wait a minute!\nHELMUT\nYou thought you were having money\nproblems before? Wait till cable\ngets their hands on this story.\nBill Maher is gon’ fuck you up!\nFLETCHER\nI have heard enough --\n106.\nHELMUT\n-- Wait I’m sorry. Look from where\nI’m sitting this place is a\ngoldmine.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nWhat?\nHELMUT\nFor one we got to show the events\nthat led up to the party --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n-- That already happened.\nHELMUT\nWell yeah, but we can reenact --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n-- reenact?\nHELMUT\nDocumentary term...Look, I can\nstart putting together an overall\ndeal today. I’m talking real money!\nTurns out the one thing America\nlikes in it’s reality more than\nignant Black folks, is crazy racist\nWhite people!\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNow you look here. This is an\nhonorable institution. The idea\nthat we would so much as entertain\nthis suggestion --\nFletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.\nFLETCHER\nHow much we talking?\nFairbanks’ outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one\nwinner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.\n100 CUT TO BLACK. 100\n107.1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy" ;
