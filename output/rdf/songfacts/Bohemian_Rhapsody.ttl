No, we will not let you go (let him go)\nBismillah! We will not let you go (let him go)\nBismillah! We will not let you go (let me go)\nWill not let you go (let me go)\nNever, never, never, never let me go\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nOh, mama mia, mama mia\nMama mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\nFor me\nFor me\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby\nCan't do this to me, baby\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here\n\nOoooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah\n\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\n\nAny way the wind blows\n                                                  \n                                                  Writer/s: Freddie Mercury \n\n                                                   Publisher: Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Tratore, Publishing Test Account\n\n                                                  Lyrics licensed and provided by LyricFind\n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                                  " ;
