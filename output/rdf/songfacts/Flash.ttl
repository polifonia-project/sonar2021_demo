Ah-ah\nHe'll save everyone of us\n\n(Seemingly, there is no reason for these extraordinary intergalactical upsets)\n(What's happening, Flash?)\n(Only Doctor Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation)\n\nFlash! Ah-ah\nHe's a miracle\n\n(This morning's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm)\n\nFlash! Ah-ah\nKing of the impossible\n\nHe's for every one of us\nStand for every one of us\nHe saves with a mighty hand\nEvery man, every woman\nEvery child, it's the mighty Flash\n\n(General Kala, Flash Gordon approaching)\n(What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching?\n(Open fire! All weapons!)\n(Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body)\n\nFlash! Ah-ah\n(Gordon's alive!)\n\nFlash! Ah-ah\nHe'll save every one of us\n\nJust a man with a man's courage\nYou know he's nothing but a man\nAnd he can never fail\nNo one but the pure at heart\nMay find the Golden Grail\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n\n(Flash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!)\nFlash\n                                                  \n                                                  Writer/s: Brian Harold May \n\n                                                   Publisher: Warner Chappell Music, Inc.\n\n                                                  Lyrics licensed and provided by LyricFind\n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                                  " ;
